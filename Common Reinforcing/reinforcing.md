# Common Reinforcing Structures

Chapter 1 presented Bertalanffy's premise that that the same basic structures operated across all disciplines, and if one learned how these structures operated one could transfer much of their learning from one discipline to another. In the previous chapters there has been a focus on three basic structures in support of Bertalanffy's premise. In this chapter will will build on those three basic structures in such a way as to demonstrate that there exists a set of more complex structures composed of combinations of the basic three which also repeatedly occur across all disciplines of science.

The sections of this chapter will present an investigation of the more frequently experienced structures and their characteristic patterns of behavior. Links will be provided at the end of the chapter to allow you to continue investigation of those structures not presented here.

Each structure will be presented in a generic form so you can focus on the implications of the relationships rather than what the actual elements are. Each section will also provide appropriate strategies for dealing with the structure as well as a number of explicit example of this structure in different areas.

Because the Reinforcing/Exponential Growth structures have already been presented we'll simply begin with more complex structures.

## Growth Slows Over Time ##

A Limits to Growth Systems Archetype consists of a Reinforcing Loop, the growth of which, after some success, is offset by the action of a Balancing Loop. As such it may produce exponential growth for a period of time before the growth slows.

# End Model

~ Exercise

The structure provided for Limits to Growth limits growth via a balancing loop that attempts to move [results] in the direction of the [limiting factor]. How else might you construct a limits to growth structure.

~ Answer

The [limiting factor] could interact with [results] in such a way that what becomes limited is the [action] that produces the [results].

~ End Exercise

### Examples ###

- Rabbits tend to multiply very rapidly so why is it we're not completely overrun by rabbits, well maybe everywhere except Australia?
- Keep playing instead of cleaning up the mess in the room, which makes further play difficult, AND the increased mess repels one from cleaning up.
- An epidemic begins with a infected person 

### Effective Strategies ###

- The best defense is a good offense. As defined in the effective strategies for the Reinforcing Loop, if there is a Reinforcing Loop operating start looking for what is going to become a limiting factor, and remove it before it even has a chance to create a substantial impact on the result.
- If the structure is already at a stage where the limiting factor is interacting with results to limit results the options are:
- Alter the limiting factor in such a way that it no longer interacts with the results to create a slowing action.
- Find a way to disconnect the results from the slowing action so it can no longer add to it.
- Disconnect the slowing action from the results so it can no longer have a negative impact.

### Areas of Concern ###

- There are often multiple limits to deal with which leads to an Attractiveness Principle.
- It is possible that limited shared resources are the source of the limiting factor leading to a Tragedy of the Commons.
- The limit may be insufficient capacity which leads to Growth and Underinvestment.

## Partners for Growth Become Adversaries ##

Susan was feeling more than slightly down. She hadn't had a real good day at school and now was headed for volleyball practice. She wondered why she stayed on the team since she could hardly remember the last time they won a game. She realized that winning wasn't everything though winning once in a while would be nice.

During volleyball practice there was a coaching session where the coach talked about the difference between all the players pulling together rather then each trying to be the star player. Susan had heard this before and was really waiting for the coach to be done so they could get back to practice.

The coach then did something rather unexpected. The coach gave each of the eight players on the team a piece of string and asked the players to try to break it. Susan thought this was rather stupid as she easily broke the string. Then the coach gave each player a longer piece of string and asked them to put them all together. Then the coach asked fours girls to get on each end of the eight strands of strings and try to break them. As hard as they tried they couldn't break the strings.

The coach then asked what the team had learned. Mary commented that it looked as though all the strings together were much stronger than the individual strings. The coach then asked if that might also be true for the girls when they acted together as a team rather than each one trying to be the star player. Susan though this a rather striking contrast.

After practice Susan was headed home though rather dreading dinner and the evening at home as she and her mother had been at odds with each other all week. As she continued her walk all of a sudden she thought, maybe her an her mother were having the same problem as the volleyball team. As she arrived at home and walk in the kitchen she said, "Mom, I learned something rather surprising at practice today."

The situation with the volleyball team and with Susan and her mother is typically referred to as an accidental adversaries scenario. In this situation two or more parties who could should be supporting each other to achieve results are actually working against each other because of their efforts to promote their own success or position.

The Accidental Adversaries structure represents a situation where two entities which would be in a synergistic growth relationship end up limiting each others results because of their own activities.

The problem arises when either A or B does something that promotes their own success which also acts to inhibit the success of the other. The other responds with an attempt to compensate for whatever is inhibiting their success though their action tends to inhibit the success of the other. As such the two entities that should be cooperating for their mutual success become adversaries.

# End Model

~ Exercise

Why is it that the results balance whenever B to B Ctrl = A to A Ctrl?

~ Answer

Simply because the structure is constructed in a balanced way. In a real situation this is not likely to be the case.

~ End Exercise

### Examples ###

- Parents can be interesting. Both Mums and Dads want to act as good role models and create a positive family environment, but sometimes, each one of them gets caught up in being seen as ''the good parent" and gives in to our whims and desires. We all know how this works: If one parent says 'no' to something, we just ask the other parent. The problem is that when one or both of our parents wants to be seen as the ''good parent,'' the other one ends up being seen as the 'bad' or 'tough' parent, and the whole 'good role model' or 'good family environment' disintegrates pretty quickly. 
- Sales and service acting promoting their own success over promoting each others success.
- Any two individuals who could cooperatively support each others success though who choose to compete with each other actually to the detriments of each other and themselves.

### Effective Strategies ###

This structure points out how myopic local activity, with the best of intentions, can lead to an overall limiting development of the global system, and actually inhibit local development as well.
- A and B need to determine whether it is really better to be partners in creating the future or competitors, and do one or the other, not both. At present A and B are neither as they undermine each others success to promote their own success. Sounds like enemies to me.
- Alternatively, some higher authority could alter the structure in such a way that A to A and B to B didn't promote the individual result of A and B.
- Another alternative would be to alter the structure in such a way that the result is not measured in terms of A and B individually but in terms of the total result of the two of them together. In this way it should be quite quickly evident that each is undermining their own success through their self-serving actions.

### Areas of Concern ###

- There are currently no known Systems Archetypes that are derivatives of the Accidental Adversaries Systems Archetype.

## Limited Resources are Shared by Others ##

A Tragedy of the Commons situation exists whenever two or more activities, each, which in order to produce results, rely on a shared limited resource. Results for these activities continue to develop as long as their use of the limited resource doesn't exceed the resource limit. Once this limit is reached the results produced by each activity are limited to the level at which the resource is replenished. As an example, consider multiple departments with an organization using IT resources, until they've exhausted IT capacity.

# Model

{"title": "Tragedy of the Commons", "description": "The following model will compare two levels of resource usage for a given set of available resources.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/560"}

# End Model

~ Exercise

- What happens if either A or B decides at some point to reduce their consumption of resources?

~ End Exercise

### Examples ###

- In an organization whenever different departments use resources that support their success though which they don't have to pay for guarantees their resource demands will exceed the supply.
- Over fishing has ruined many of the offshore fishing areas simply because doing more of the same served those doing it until such time as they exceeded the carrying capacity of the system.

### Effective Strategies ###

This structure repeatedly appears in organizational contexts where a service organization supports the success of multiple departments who fail to support the service organization in return. There are two strategies for dealing with this structure, one more effective than the other.
- The most effective strategy for dealing with this structure is to wire in feedback paths from A's result and B's result to the resource replenishment so as A and B use resources their results promotes the availability of additional resources.
- The alternate, and less effective, strategy for dealing with this structure is to add an additional resource to control the use of resources by A and B. This strategy limits the overall potential results of the structure to the predefined resource limit. It also adds additional resources to the equation, and probably results in endless disputes as to the fairness associated with the allocation of resources. While not really the most appropriate strategy this is the one most often used --- out of ignorance I would suspect.
- More ecological approach would be for A and B to realize what they're doing and collaboratively manage their activity and the resource such that it isn't depleted. Yes, it could happen.

## Summary ##

The chapter should have explicitly depicted the relationships between the common reinforcing structures and explained the natural evolution paths for these structures.
