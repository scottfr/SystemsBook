# Applied Understanding

This chapter will present a number of models on different subjects offered by the sponsors of Beyond Connecting the Dots

## Systemic Strategy ##

As we think about the problems we face today it becomes readily evident that the majority of these problems are the direct result of yesterday’s solutions. If we desire to enable a better tomorrow, the foundation of that tomorrow must be the development of a viable approach for dealing with situations. We need an approach which actually addresses the situation while minimizing the likelihood of making the situation worse or creating new problems that we will have to address in the future. The foundation of this approach, as with all real progress, is learning. This paper presents a model for the requisite learning.

### Background ###

Over the years numerous new approaches to problem solving have been developed and promoted. Some of these were turned into fads and readily adopted by many. The fads were not well founded and in time proved not to deliver the expected results. When the expected results were not delivered the fads were discarded in favor of the next fad. As Michael McGill [1991] points out, the real difficulty lies in a flawed mental model under which both the promoters and the adopters operate. That flawed mental model being their belief that there should exist a quick fix.

In contrast, well grounded and proven approaches to problem solving have not been widely adopted. Those with flawed mental models consider the proven approaches to be too complicated or time consuming. The quest for the ever elusive quick fix condemns us to repeatedly solving the new problems created by the quick fix. This is the type of result expected from operating with flawed mental models [Senge, 1990] We must realize the quick fix is a mirage and invest the time to learn the proven methods and create sound solutions.

### The Future We Create ###

Whether we’re considering a problem, a situation, an objective, or a desire, the underlying essence of the manner in which we proceed to deal with it is the essentially the same.

# End Model

Whether we realize it or not this model can be applied to just about everything that happens in our lives. Even when we don’t consciously think about it the interactions depicted in Fig. 1 are operating. The extent to which people consciously think about these relations varies. Some people think about the implication of their actions and stop there. And some people think about the implications of implications of implications. They do this because they understand that things are highly interconnected and the implications are difficult to foresee.

### Systemic Strategy ###

Given the realization that there is an underlying set of interactions as depicted in Fig. 1 which is essentially the foundation of all our endeavors, seeking a deeper awareness of how we develop the requisite understanding would seem a sensible undertaking. An introduction to developing this understanding is depicted in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2 represents an iterative unfolding of understanding intended to provide the basis for developing a strategy which, when implemented, is highly likely to address the situation of interest as intended, while minimizing the likelihood of unintended consequences or creating new problems.

## Victims of the System or Systems of the Victim ##

American business is in its fifth decade of management fads. In some organizations the fads have worked, in most they have not, and in some they have even made matters worse. Many reasons have been advanced for the failure of fads, none of them quite complete. The fault lies not with the fads, but with our attempt to use them to change things for which we have insufficient understanding. 

Experience has taught us well to react to events and to respond to patterns of behavior. Yet, there is a deeper level of understanding possible. An understanding on the level of structure. There are underlying structures responsible for the patterns of behavior and the events. Our lack of awareness of these structures often makes us the victim of them, even though many of the structures are of our own creation. The structures are not hidden, they are simply not obvious. We have never developed a way to see and understand them. Once we become aware of structures, know how to look for them, and understand them, they become readily apparent all around us.

Yes, we're being very redundant though the message we're trying to convey is essential. Models are a critical component of developing understanding and we have to keep asking AND? And what else is happening here that's relevant to what's happening and essential to include for the understanding we're trying to achieve.

There's a new normal in careers across many industries.  While 12 M americans are unemployed and 12 million are underemployed, over 3 Million jobs remain unfilled due to skills mismatch.  This summer at the National Boy Scout Jamboree over 45,000 boys and their leaders heard Mike Rowe from DIrty Jobs talk about the disconnection between today's and tomorrows careers and our system of K-12, college and university education.  ( I have a very cool 2 min video clip)

In a day when the suicide rate among vets has never been higher the amount of student loan debt has never been greater and the number of hard working well meaning Americans with 20-30 years of strong work experience have lost there jobs due to no fault of their own and exhausted 99 weeks of unemployment insurance - it may well be time to reexamine some of the classical decision making around when and how to make the best decisions around careers.

Perhaps a plumber who graduates High school and starts to make 30,000 in his first year and saves 10% a year and sees his earning rise to 33, 36, 42, 50, 60, 70 K over 10 years, saving 10% by living within his mens may be well ahead of the dentist student who goes into debt to finish school, open a practice and defers savings 10 years.  These models are meant to tease these issues out in an engaging way.

How long would it take the dentist to catch up?

See his Mike Rowes website "Proundly disconnected" for more information on the importance of recoonecting education to more effective career choices

What are the implications for K-12 and college advising?

Perhaps career choice decisions are one of the most relevant areas of strategic thinking any parent and counselor could involve their children and students in.

THis chapter/appendix of models begins to get to some of these issues.

## Sustainable Capitalism / Ken Shepard ##

The current life expectancy for a Fortune-500 company is 40 to 50 years, less than 10 years for a newly started company, and about 12.5 years for all companies together. And during this lifespan the tendency is to focus on short-term profits with little or no concern for the impact the company has on society or the environment. Have you ever wondered about the reasons behind this? This model is from Mark Van Clieaf sponsored by Ken Shepard.

### Conclusion ###

If we are to evolve beyond the Pogo predicament, “We have met the enemy and he is us” [Kelly, 1970] it is essential we embrace learning and become far more adept at developing truly viable approaches for dealing with situations. And attempting to deal with situations without the requisite level of understanding has repeatedly proven to be little more than meddling which makes the situation worse or creates new problems that have to be dealt with. There are well defined proven approaches for developing each aspect of the model presented in Fig. 2. [Bellinger, 2012] These can be explored in more detail in the videos at the Systemic Perspective/Foundations page on the Systems Thinking World Wiki.
