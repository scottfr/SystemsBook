## Forward/Preface/Intro ##

Scott & I set out five months ago to develop an interactive book on modeling and simulation using Insight Maker. As it turned out, after four months we had developed an interactive book on modeling and simulation using Insight Maker. What we realized, upon arriving at the goal, was that the world didn't need another book on modeling and simulation and it surely didn't need an Insight Maker users guide. And glitzy technology couldn't turn what we had developed into what it needed to be.
