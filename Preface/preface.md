## Preface ##

People always, always, always do exactly what makes the most amount of sense to them in the context of the moment based on their current understanding. The future is a result of our actions. Our actions are based on what we beliefs. Many of our beliefs are based on incorrect assumptions and conclusions. What implications do you think that has for our future? You may also have heard that the majority of today's problems are the direct result of yesterday's solutions. There's a famous quote from Pogo, "We have met the enemy and he is us" Steven Covey commented that true pro-activity begins when one begins to understand they extent to which they actually contribute to the situation. All of this should provide a sense that if we want things to be better tomorrow we need to get better, though what does that mean?

Why is it that as we approach our goals they seem to be more difficult to achieve? Why is it that things progressing so well seem sooner or later to turn sour? And when things turn sour, how is it that they seem to do so in such a rapid fashion? Why is it that every problem we solve seems simply to lead to a whole new set of problems? Why is it that the problems we thought we solved yesterday seem to come back to haunt us in a few weeks or months? Why is it that a group of individuals each doing what seems so sensible manages to create something that none of them want, i.e. bureaucracy? Why it is that no matter how much money I make it never seems to be enough? Why is it that co-operative partnerships that should produce tremendous results so often end with the partners becoming adversaries? 

The list of questions is rather endless, and our normal pursuit from a cause and effect perspective is to try to find where the fault lies. A systems perspective, however, enables us to understand the foundations of such situations. A systems perspective enables one to progress beyond simply seeing events, to seeing patterns of interaction and the underlying structures which are responsible for the patterns. And, once we understand the real foundations for the situations we experience, we are in a much better position to respond in an enlightened fashion. We are able to act responsibly and interact with the structures in ways which will enhance or improve the situation without making the situation worse or creating new problems elsewhere.

Whether we’re considering a problem, a situation, an objective, or a desire, the underlying essence of the manner in which we proceed to deal with it is the essentially the same.

Given a situation that we consider warrants attention we first need to develop an understanding. An understanding that will enable us to develop a strategy which actually improves the situation while minimizing unintended consequences. Our desire to minimize unintended consequences is based on our experiences. We have learned that unintended consequences typically make the initial situation worse or end up creating new problems that we ourselves or others have to figure out how to deal with. A well crafted strategy well executed can serve to minimize unintended consequences; although whatever unintended consequences still arise are likely to make the situation worse or result in new problems. The total elimination of unintended consequences is generally impossible.

Whether we realize it or not Fig. 1 can be applied to just about everything that happens in our lives. Even when we don’t consciously think about it the interactions depicted in Fig. 1 are operating. The extent to which people consciously think about these relations varies. Some people think about the implication of their actions and stop there. And some people think about the implications of implications of implications. They do this because they understand that things are highly interconnected and the implications are difficult to foresee.

Why is this an important book for our time? It is important because of the understanding it can help us develop - understanding why the world we have created has become apparently so complicated, and what to do about it. Over time we have woven the fabric of our existence ever tighter, and with ever more rapid interactions. And, when we do not understand the complexity we have created, we feel helpless, and become victims of what we do not understand.

Beyond Connecting the Dots enables us to develop a better understanding of the world around us, why this understanding is so important to us in our daily lives, and how we can all can benefit from the understanding. Once we embrace the complexity we have created, and find the simplicity on the other side, we no longer need to be victims, for we can use our understanding to change our actions and thereby our world.
