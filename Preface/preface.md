## Forward/Preface/Intro ##

Scott & I set out five months ago to develop an interactive book on modeling and simulation using Insight Maker. As it turned out, after four months we had developed an interactive book on modeling and simulation using Insight Maker. What we realized, upon arriving at the goal, was that the world didn't need another book on modeling and simulation and it surely didn't need an Insight Maker users guide. And glitzy technology couldn't turn what we had developed into what it needed to be. Though a glitzy technology oriented book on modeling and simulation that read like an Insight Maker users guide was just what we had created.

Fortunately for us a couple of our insightful and courageous sponsors were willing to tell us in no uncertain terms that the emperor had no cloths, and they were willing to repeat it till they got our attention. So the reconstruction along with a couple intense positioning discussions ensued. During that exchange our thoughts migrated from thinking of the creation as a book, to an app, and finally to an Interactive Learning Environment (ILE), though not an ILE about modeling and simulation or about Insight Maker. The realization that emerged was that the ILE needed to present an approach for the user to better understand and deal with the world around them in a manner significantly better than it would have been before interacting with this ILE.

With all this awakening the label for this creation is beginning to look something like "Systems Insights for Y/Our Future: An Interactive Learning Environment" with a strong emphasis on "interactive." With the end of August beta release Chapter 1 and part of Chapter 2 serve as a good model for the direction of the first five chapters. And with this emphasis on interactive there is a question as to the sensibility of trying to create a physical copy of this ILE. There are aspects of the interaction currently created in the first chapter that would be completely lost in a physical copy of the ILE, and you can let us know your thoughts after you experience Chapter 1, which is available for access and comment via the sponsors subgroup on LinkedIn.

An additional realization is that the ILE is just that an interactive learning environment. It is not a development environment. While one can construct models and simulations in the environment any serious development should be done at InsightMaker.com because of the difference in the interfaces. And we've also learning that there are critical functions that can be performed on a workstation for which there is no equivalent on a tablet or cell phone, e.g., mouseover, shift+click, ctrl+click, which are critical operations for doing some things. As you experience the restructured Chapter 1 you'll get a sens of this if you're on a tablet or cell phone.

We're rapidly transforming the Chapters 3 though 8 into the ILE form and we should have a new release every two weeks going forward from here.
