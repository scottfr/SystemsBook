## Preface ##

We set out to develop an interactive ebook on modeling and simulation introducing Insight Maker. After a few months what had actually been developed was an interactive ebook on modeling and simulation introducing Insight Maker. Upon arriving at the goal we realized that the world didn't need another book on modeling and simulation, and it surely didn't need an Insight Maker User's Guide. And, glitzy technology couldn't turn what we had developed into what it needed to be, though a glitzy technology-oriented book on modeling and simulation that read like an Insight Maker User's Guide was just what we had created.

Fortunately a few of our insightful and courageous sponsors were willing to tell us in no uncertain terms that the emperor had no clothes, and they were willing to repeat this until we got the message. So the reconstruction, along with a couple of intense positioning discussions, ensued. During that exchange our thoughts migrated from thinking of the creation as a book, to thinking of it as an app, and finally as an Interactive Learning Environment (ILE). We didn't think of it as an ILE about modeling and simulation or about Insight Maker. Ultimately we realized that the ILE needed to present an approach for users to better understand and deal with the world around them in a manner significantly better than they would have been able to before interacting with this ILE.

With this awakening we discussed titles like "Systems Insights for Y/Our Future: An Interactive Learning Environment". Aren't you pleased we decided to name it something else? The August 30, 2013 beta release of Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 served as a good model for the direction of the first few chapters. And with this emphasis on interaction we began to question the sensibility of trying to create a physical copy of the ILE. There are valuable aspects of interaction that would be completely lost in a physical copy of the ILE. After you experience this interactive learning environment you can let us know whether our thoughts were appropriate.

We also discovered that the ILE is just that, an ***interactive learning environment***. It is not a development environment. While one can construct models and simulations in the environment, any serious development should be done in Insight Maker at [InsightMaker.com](http://insightmaker.com/). Additionally, certain functions, e.g., mouseover, shift+click, ctrl+click are critical operations for some aspects of development can be performed on a workstation but not on a tablet or cell phone. Alternatives for these are presented in the Introduction.

We sincerely hope that you find this effort meaningful and that it provides you with a basis for developing a more useful understanding of the world around you.

## Introduction ##

People tend to read books in different ways. With that in mind we've designed this ILE so all the essential concepts are presented in the first chapter. We recommend that you read Chapter 1 and interact with all the models presented. Chapters 2 and 3 provide examples to reinforce the concepts of Chapter 1. These are recommended, though you can probably interact with them in any order you desire. The remainder of the chapters contain related modeling and simulation concepts that may be read in any desired order.

The first three chapters present concepts and access to models as depicted in Figure 1. 

![Figure 1. Accessing Models](00-intro-01.png)

- **Navigation** - Click to the right of center on the display to advance to the next page. Click to the left of center on the display to advance to the previous page.
- **Table of Content** - Click on the title in the upper left corner to display a Table of Contents. You can scroll through and click on a particular section to go directly to that section.
- **Navigation Slider** - Click on the title in the lower left corner to display a slider; use this to navigate directly to other sections of the content.
- **Page Numbers** - The concept of page numbers isn't relevant in this context because you can size the display window, thus altering the size of the virtual page.
- **Text Size** - Click the "AA" in the upper right corner of the page to toggle between two text sizes.
- **Model Access** - Click on the title of the model to open the model in a storytelling mode. Once you open the model, read the text at the bottom of the screen and step through the story by clicking the **Step Forward** button at the bottom right. Once you're finished with the model click the **Close** tab at the top of the model to return to where you were in the text.

Some of the models simply tell a story as in Figure 2 by unfolding a model in pictures as you step through the model.

![Figure 2. Display of a Model](00-intro-02.png)

Some models will actually run simulations at certain steps as you step though the model as depicted in Figure 3. 

![Figure 3. Model Simulation Run](00-intro-03.png)

The storytelling mode will close the graph and continue when you click on **Step Forward**.

In some models you will be given the option to change parameters and then run one or more simulations on your own and will appear as in Figure 4. This is designed to help you become more familiar with the implications of the relationships in the model.

![Figure 4. Running Simulations](00-intro-04.png)

In this mode you can alter parameters and run simulations as many times as you like. Once you've looked at the simulation output, click the **red x** in the upper right corner of the graph to close it and get back to the model.

If you click on an element of the model the **Configuration Panel** on the right shows all the attributes for the element you've selected. If you click anywhere on the model background, this panel will return to the variables control panel depicted in Figure 4.

Notice there is a double caret symbol in the upper right of the **Configuration Panel**. Click this to close the panel. The double caret will reverse direction and look like it does in Figure 2.

Don't be overwhelmed by all of the items; there are only two fields you need to be concerned with here. The first is the **Note** field. The second is in the **Configuration** section and will have different names depending on which type of model element you select. Based on the other connected elements, it should be obvious which field contains the formula that defines the way that element behaves. Don't be discouraged if you feel a little lost at this point. Some of this won't make sense until you get through part of Chapter 1. Our objective is to give you a sense of what to expect. 

If you click in either the **Note** field or the **Equation Field** (which will have different names for different elements) a downward arrow will appear in the right of the field. If you click this downward arrow a window will open so that you can read the notes or inspect the equation associated with that element.

![Figure 5. Configuration Panel with Flow Rate Clicked](00-intro-05.png)

Figure 6 is an example of what the **Equations Editor** window looks like. Once you have finished viewing this window you will need to click the **x** in the upper right to close the window.

![Figure 6. Equations Editor Window](00-intro-06.png)

Figure 7 is an example of what the **Notes Editor** window looks like. Once you've finished reading the notes, click the **x** in the upper right corner to close the window.

![Figure 7. Note Editor](00-intro-07.png)

Don’t be concerned that the windows in Figure 6 and Figure 7 are labeled as editor windows. You can’t make any permanent changes. Any changes you make are only retained while you're in the model. Once you leave a model and return to the text, the model will be returned to its original state.

Look closely at Figure 8. Notice an **= equal sign** and an **i** visible on the **current state** element. If you're working on a device that has a mouseover function, these will show up when you mouseover the element. You can click the **= equal sign** to open the **Equations Editor** and the **i** to open the **Note** for the element.

![Figure 8. Mouse Over Equation/Note Selection](00-intro-08.png)

You can open the **Configuration Panel**, or use mouseover, to look at any element parameter at any time during the storytelling of a model.

There are numerous exercises presented. In some cases we provide answers for your review; in others we simply present questions related to concepts for reflection. Reflecting with others can be very beneficial.

Implications of this being an interactive learning environment rather than a development environment are:

- **No Storytelling Exit**. There is no way to exit from the storytelling mode. You can open the **Toolbar** and **Configuration Panel** and make changes to any model while in storytelling mode, and run simulations where appropriate, though these changes can not be saved.
- **Insight Maker Model Link**. For each model there is a footnote that contains a link to the actual source of the model in [InsightMaker.com](http://insightmaker.com/). There you may clone the model, creating a copy that you own. You can then interact with your copy of the model with all the features of Insight Maker.

You can read and interact with this content without being connected to the Internet, though some of the models reference images on the Internet. If you're not connected to the Internet these will display as missing images with labels below them. You will also not be able to follow any of the embedded links unless you are connected to the Internet.

Now that you've made it though the introduction you are ready to begin and enjoy your interactive learning journey.
