## Preface ##

The future is a result of our actions. Our actions are based on what we beliefs. Many of our beliefs are based on incorrect assumptions and conclusions. What implications do you think that has for our future?

People always, always, always do exactly what makes the most amount of sense to them in the context of the moment based on their current understanding.

You may also have heard that the majority of today's problems are the direct result of yesterday's solutions.

There's a famous quote from Pogo, "We have met the enemy and he is us"

And Steven Covey commented that true proactivity begins when one begins to understand they extent to which they actually contribute to the situation.

This should provide a sense that if we want things to be better tomorrow we need to get better, though what does that mean?
