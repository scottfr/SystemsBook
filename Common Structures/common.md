# Frequently Recurring Structures

Chapter 1 presented Bertalanffy's premise that that the same basic structures operated across all disciplines, and if one learned how these structures operated one could transfer much of their learning from one discipline to another. In the previous chapters there has been a focus on three basic structures in support of Bertalanffy's premise. In this chapter will will build on those three basic structures in such a way as to demonstrate that there exists a set of more complex structures composed of combinations of the basic three which also repeatedly occur across all disciplines of science.

## Basic Structures ##

In the Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 we covered these three basic structures in some detail and it was claimed that all the models you will ever create will simply be a combination of some number of these basic structures. We don't expect that you take this on faith, and while we can't prove it, this chapter, and the next two, will provide you an opportunity to experience some of the more common structures which repeatedly occur across all disciplines of science.

## Systems Archetypes ##

There are a set of frequently recurring structures that have a very distinct structure and characteristic pattern of behavior. Understanding the manner in which the relations within these structures unfold can be very helpful in determining how to deal with situation.

## Reinforcing Structures ##

The sections of this chapter will present an investigation of the more frequently experienced structures and their characteristic patterns of behavior. Links will be provided at the end of the chapter to allow you to continue investigation of those structures not presented here.

Each structure will be presented in a generic form so you can focus on the implications of the relationships rather than what the actual elements are. Each section will also provide appropriate strategies for dealing with the structure as well as a number of explicit example of this structure in different areas.

Because the Reinforcing/Exponential Growth structures have already been presented we'll simply begin with more complex structures.

## Growth Slows Over Time ##

A Limits to Growth Systems Archetype consists of a Reinforcing Loop, the growth of which, after some success, is offset by the action of a Balancing Loop. As such it may produce exponential growth for a period of time before the growth slows.

# Model

{"title": "Limits to Growth", "description": "The natural exponential growth of the reinforcing structure is restricted by a balancing loop.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/551"}

# End Model

~ Exercise

The structure provided for Limits to Growth limits growth via a balancing loop that attempts to move [results] in the direction of the [limiting factor]. How else might you construct a limits to growth structure.

~ Answer

The [limiting factor] could interact with [results] in such a way that what becomes limited is the [action] that produces the [results].

~ End Exercise

### Examples ###

- Rabbits tend to multiply very rapidly so why is it we're not completely overrun by rabbits, well maybe everywhere except Australia?
- Keep playing instead of cleaning up the mess in the room, which makes further play difficult, AND the increased mess repels one from cleaning up.
- An epidemic begins with a infected person 

### Effective Strategies ###

- The best defense is a good offense. As defined in the effective strategies for the Reinforcing Loop, if there is a Reinforcing Loop operating start looking for what is going to become a limiting factor, and remove it before it even has a chance to create a substantial impact on the result.
- If the structure is already at a stage where the limiting factor is interacting with results to limit results the options are:
- Alter the limiting factor in such a way that it no longer interacts with the results to create a slowing action.
- Find a way to disconnect the results from the slowing action so it can no longer add to it.
- Disconnect the slowing action from the results so it can no longer have a negative impact.

### Areas of Concern ###

- There are often multiple limits to deal with which leads to an Attractiveness Principle.
- It is possible that limited shared resources are the source of the limiting factor leading to a Tragedy of the Commons.
- The limit may be insufficient capacity which leads to Growth and Underinvestment.

## Partners for Growth Become Adversaries ##

Susan was feeling more than slightly down. She hadn't had a real good day at school and now was headed for volleyball practice. She wondered why she stayed on the team since she could hardly remember the last time they won a game. She realized that winning wasn't everything though winning once in a while would be nice.

During volleyball practice there was a coaching session where the coach talked about the difference between all the players pulling together rather then each trying to be the star player. Susan had heard this before and was really waiting for the coach to be done so they could get back to practice.

The coach then did something rather unexpected. The coach gave each of the eight players on the team a piece of string and asked the players to try to break it. Susan thought this was rather stupid as she easily broke the string. Then the coach gave each player a longer piece of string and asked them to put them all together. Then the coach asked fours girls to get on each end of the eight strands of strings and try to break them. As hard as they tried they couldn't break the strings.

The coach then asked what the team had learned. Mary commented that it looked as though all the strings together were much stronger than the individual strings. The coach then asked if that might also be true for the girls when they acted together as a team rather than each one trying to be the star player. Susan though this a rather striking contrast.

After practice Susan was headed home though rather dreading dinner and the evening at home as she and her mother had been at odds with each other all week. As she continued her walk all of a sudden she thought, maybe her an her mother were having the same problem as the volleyball team. As she arrived at home and walk in the kitchen she said, "Mom, I learned something rather surprising at practice today."

The situation with the volleyball team and with Susan and her mother is typically referred to as an accidental adversaries scenario. In this situation two or more parties who could should be supporting each other to achieve results are actually working against each other because of their efforts to promote their own success or position.

The Accidental Adversaries structure represents a situation where two entities which would be in a synergistic growth relationship end up limiting each others results because of their own activities.

The problem arises when either A or B does something that promotes their own success which also acts to inhibit the success of the other. The other responds with an attempt to compensate for whatever is inhibiting their success though their action tends to inhibit the success of the other. As such the two entities that should be cooperating for their mutual success become adversaries.

# End Model

~ Exercise

Why is it that the results balance whenever B to B Ctrl = A to A Ctrl?

~ Answer

Simply because the structure is constructed in a balanced way. In a real situation this is not likely to be the case.

~ End Exercise

### Examples ###

- Parents can be interesting. Both Mums and Dads want to act as good role models and create a positive family environment, but sometimes, each one of them gets caught up in being seen as ''the good parent" and gives in to our whims and desires. We all know how this works: If one parent says 'no' to something, we just ask the other parent. The problem is that when one or both of our parents wants to be seen as the ''good parent,'' the other one ends up being seen as the 'bad' or 'tough' parent, and the whole 'good role model' or 'good family environment' disintegrates pretty quickly. 
- Sales and service acting promoting their own success over promoting each others success.
- Any two individuals who could cooperatively support each others success though who choose to compete with each other actually to the detriments of each other and themselves.

### Effective Strategies ###

This structure points out how myopic local activity, with the best of intentions, can lead to an overall limiting development of the global system, and actually inhibit local development as well.
- A and B need to determine whether it is really better to be partners in creating the future or competitors, and do one or the other, not both. At present A and B are neither as they undermine each others success to promote their own success. Sounds like enemies to me.
- Alternatively, some higher authority could alter the structure in such a way that A to A and B to B didn't promote the individual result of A and B.
- Another alternative would be to alter the structure in such a way that the result is not measured in terms of A and B individually but in terms of the total result of the two of them together. In this way it should be quite quickly evident that each is undermining their own success through their self-serving actions.

### Areas of Concern ###

- There are currently no known Systems Archetypes that are derivatives of the Accidental Adversaries Systems Archetype.

## Limited Resources are Shared by Others ##

A Tragedy of the Commons situation exists whenever two or more activities, each, which in order to produce results, rely on a shared limited resource. Results for these activities continue to develop as long as their use of the limited resource doesn't exceed the resource limit. Once this limit is reached the results produced by each activity are limited to the level at which the resource is replenished. As an example, consider multiple departments with an organization using IT resources, until they've exhausted IT capacity.

# Model

{"title": "Tragedy of the Commons", "description": "The following model will compare two levels of resource usage for a given set of available resources.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/560"}

# End Model

~ Exercise

- What happens if either A or B decides at some point to reduce their consumption of resources?

~ End Exercise

### Examples ###

- In an organization whenever different departments use resources that support their success though which they don't have to pay for guarantees their resource demands will exceed the supply.
- Over fishing has ruined many of the offshore fishing areas simply because doing more of the same served those doing it until such time as they exceeded the carrying capacity of the system.

### Effective Strategies ###

This structure repeatedly appears in organizational contexts where a service organization supports the success of multiple departments who fail to support the service organization in return. There are two strategies for dealing with this structure, one more effective than the other.
- The most effective strategy for dealing with this structure is to wire in feedback paths from A's result and B's result to the resource replenishment so as A and B use resources their results promotes the availability of additional resources.
- The alternate, and less effective, strategy for dealing with this structure is to add an additional resource to control the use of resources by A and B. This strategy limits the overall potential results of the structure to the predefined resource limit. It also adds additional resources to the equation, and probably results in endless disputes as to the fairness associated with the allocation of resources. While not really the most appropriate strategy this is the one most often used --- out of ignorance I would suspect.
- More ecological approach would be for A and B to realize what they're doing and collaboratively manage their activity and the resource such that it isn't depleted. Yes, it could happen.

## Balancing Structures ##

The sections of this chapter will present an investigation of the more frequently experienced balancing structures and their characteristic patterns of behavior. Links will be provided at the end of the chapter to allow you to continue investigation of those structures not presented here.

Because the Balancing/Goal Seeking structure has already been presented we'll simply begin with more complex structures.

## Linear Progress Slows Over Time ##

A Limits to Results structure represents a situation where a Balancing Loop moving toward its goal is slowed in its progress due to some limiting factor. This is generally due to some resource restriction or constraint.

# Model

{"title": "Limits to Results", "description": "A balancing loop seldom progresses simply based on the difference between the [current state] and the [desired state].", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/543"}

# End Model

~ Exercise

- Run the model with different values for limit. What difference do you see in the curve when the limit is evenly divisible into 1.
- What happens if you change the Time Step to 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125. What is the most appropriate value to use for Time Step?

~ Answer

- If the limit is evenly divisible into 1 then there is no change in the cure as the goal is reached.
- There isn't a noticeable difference between the graph for 0.25 and 0.125 so 0.25 would be the most appropriate value to use for Time Step.

~ End Exercise

### Examples ###

Numerous example for this structure should readily come to mind.

- Any undertaking to complete a project is restricted by the availability of resources.
- The flow of anything to fill or empty a stock is restricted by the capacity of what the liquid must flow through.
- The rate of production of a process is limited by the capacity of the process.

### Effective Strategy ###

- The effective way to avoid a Limits to Results scenario is simply to plan ahead to ensure there are sufficient resources available so progress toward results is not limited to a greater extent than acceptable. That said, remember that more of a good thing is not always the best answer. There is often a trade off and more resources may cost more than one gains by reducing the time by using more resources. There's always more than one thing that should be considered.

## The Fix Overshoots the Goal ##

Have you ever pursued a goal and later found that you actually overshot the goal and had to back up to get back to the goal? The Balancing Loop with Delay structure is a variation of the standard Balancing Loop. The variation being that there are one or more delays in the structure which are responsible for producing, as will be demonstrated, a very different behavior pattern than the standard Balancing Loop.

If you look at the Balancing Loop with Delay structure it looks identical to the standard balancing loop with the exception of the delay near the reduces link. The implication is that it takes some amount of time after the current state changes before it is actually realized and figures into the calculation of the gap which influences the subsequent action. Essentially what's happening is that action is being based on old data and therefore is probably not the appropriate action. The implications of this will become evident when we look at the simulation for this structure.

# Model

{"title": "The Fix Overshoots The Goal", "description": "Lets take a look at the implications of varying delays on the effect of a balancing loop.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/133"}

# End Model

You might ask how could it be that it might take 3.5 days for someone to get a sense of what the results of the previous actions were, which would be a good question. It's probably difficult to find a situation where this is realistic in days though what's important to realize is this structure could operate in this manner if the time units were hours, minutes, seconds or microseconds.

~ Exercise 

Run this model varying the values of action factor, time delay and time step to develop a sense of how each of these variables influences the behavior of the model.

~ End Exercise

### Examples ###

- **Adjusting the Shower**. When you adjust the hot and cold water for the shower it takes time for the new mixing ratio to actually be felt in the water temperature to it's easy to over compensate due to impatience.

### Effective Strategies ###

- Advice for dealing with this structure is quite simple. Patience is a virtue. If you know you're dealing with a balancing structure and things are not going as expected then study the structure to see if there could be one or more delays that your impatience is simply having difficulty dealing with. This structure proves that there are times when taking additional action is worse than not taking additional action. More is not always better. If things are waffling back and forth endlessly or out of control a little less effort might be appropriate.
- An alternative is to monitor the Current State on a more frequent basis and ensure the result of the monitoring impacts the action appropriately in a more timely manner. In short, take the delay out of the structure.

## Over Time There Is A Tendency To Settle For Less

Have you ever noticed how difficult it is to bring the best of intentions to fruition? How so many people's New Years resolutions only last a few days? Our inability to achieve the things we set out to achieve is very much a result of the operation of a Drifting Goals structure we generally have little awareness of.

# Model

{"title": "Drifting Goals", "description": "If it takes an extended period of time to achieve a goal there is a tendency to settle for achieving a lesser goal.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/984"}

# End Model

~ Exercise

Vary the \p{pct chg fact}, \p{goal chg fact} and \p{Time Step} values to get a sense of the impact on the extent to which the goal for the structure is degraded over time.

~ End Exercise

### Examples ###

- New years resolutions. Need I say more?
- Weight loss programs.

### Effective Strategies ###

- There is only one real effective way to deal with this structure, which is to disconnect the feedback from tension to goal reduction to Desired State so it can no longer subtract from Desired State.
- An alternative strategy is to further increase the action toward the Current State so it reduces the time delay such that there is no time for the tension to reduce the Desired State. This is fine if there are sufficient resources to increase the action.

### Areas of Concern ###

- The action toward the Desired State requires resources, which may have to be developed. Consideration needs to be given as to whether or not there really are sufficient resources to achieve the Desired State. For further insights into this see Growth and Underinvestment with a Drifting Standard.

## In Time The Problem Returns ##

Have you noticed how often your best intentions go awry? You set out to fix a problem and shortly thereafter you find yourself fixing the same problem again, and again. This generally results from some unexpected consequences, things that come into play because of your action, or the results of your action, that you never expected, which is why they're called unexpected consequences.

# End Model

~ Exercise

Run the Fixes that Fail structure with various values of action factor, uc factor, ucd factor, and Time Step to get a sense of how these four factors influence the behavior of the structure.

~ End Exercise

### Examples ###

- Your soccer ball is soft so you put air in it though in a few hours you have to put more air in it. And after a few weeks it seems like you spend all your time pumping up your soccer ball.
- Often times what appears to be the most appropriate way to deal with the situation doesn't really solve the problem and in time actually makes the situation worse.
- To deal with a cash shortage one often borrows money ensuring there will be more cash problems in the future.
- In response to cash flow problems companies often choose to layoff employees essentially ensuring they will have more cash flow problems in the future.

### Effective Strategies ###

- The most effective strategy for dealing with this structure is advance planning. Since you can never do just one thing, as everything affects everything else, before taking action to change the current state, think about what else that action, or change in the current state, is likely to affect. And, what effect the effect will have. Sometimes the unexpected consequence may be several effects away, so don't stop at just one. Essentially what one seeks to do is close the loop and identify the unexpected, which means it's no longer unexpected then, is it?
- A less effective strategy would be to figure out how to disconnect the unexpected consequence from influencing the action or the current state. Of course then it wouldn't be a consequence, would it?

### Areas of Concern ###

- There are times when attempts to deal with a situation in a particular way makes it even more difficult to deal with the situation in an appropriate manner later on which is often an indication of a Shifting the Burden Systems Archetype.

## The Underlying Cause Is Not Being Addressed ##

How many times have you noticed that there are some problems that seem to be addressed over and over. When the problem arises it is addressed, then some time later, maybe a day, a week, or a month, the same problem arises again. This situation is quite often the result of a Shifting the Burden structure.

# Model

{"title": "Shifting the Burden", "description": "This model demonstrates the difference between treating the symptoms and actually solving the problem.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/1005"}

# End Model

~ Exercise

While there are myriad of possible variations for the variables in this model you might find the result interesting if you apply the fundamental solution without the symptomatic solution. What questions does this result raise?

~ Answer

Applying the \p{Fundamental Solution} without applying the \p{symptomatic solution} we end up removing the \p{problem cause} though the \p{Problem Symptom} remains. Can you think of a situation where this might occur?

~ End Exercise

### Examples ###

- Dieting to lose weight rather than changing one's lifestyle results in short term weight loss which will only last for a short time. The side effect is that the success of the diet removes the perceived need to implement the fundamental solution.

### Effective Strategies ###

Initially I perceived there to be a single appropriate strategy for dealing with this structure though I have found examples, which I will attach as soon as I get them sorted out, which seem support the range of strategies below.

- Learn to live with the symptomatic solution because that's as good as it's going to get. There are situations where there may be more effective solutions though you'll just never get them implemented in your lifetime. Sad but true.
-Implement the fundamental solution because if the symptomatic solution is implemented the strength of the side effect will ensure the fundamental solution will never get any traction.
- When dealing with a problem ask yourself if you are treating the symptoms or addressing the real cause of the problem. Often, out of expediency, the symptomatic solution is essential. The most effective strategy for dealing with a Shifting the Burden structure is to employ the symptomatic solution AND develop the fundamental solution. Thus one resolves the immediate problem and the other works to ensure that it doesn't return.

### Areas of Concern ###

- It is often the case that the side effect promotes some sort of dependency which further inhibits development of the fundamental solution. For insights into this situation see Addiction Systems Archetype.

## Summary ##

The chapter provides an introduction to the explicit relationships between the most commonly recurring structures along with their natural evolution paths. The next two chapters will provide a detailed investigation of these structures along with their characteristic pattern of behavior which will help you recognize and address them.
