“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where–” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
“–so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation.
“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”

We live in a world much like a giant spider web, where everything is connected to everything else. When something changes in one part of the web it ripples though the entire web. We tend to live in the moment, not realizing how our actions ripple over time thorough distant parts of the web. When we don't understand the web things around us tend to seem extremely complicated, confusing and overwhelming. We feel caught in the web. What we need is a web of understanding for this web of extended interactions.

It has been said that you can learn about riding a bicycle from reading a book, though to learn to ride a bicycle you actually have to spend time on a bicycle. The interactive learning environments (ILEs) you're about to experience are intended to develop a web of understanding for the web of extended interactions around you. You are encouraged to engage with these ILEs. The understanding you develop will aid you in figuring out where you want to get to and develop skills which will improve your likelihood of getting there. These ILEs are very much like reading a book about riding a bicycle as you're actually on the bicycle learning to ride it. Enjoy the experience and the learning.

## Experiencing the Web ##

Because everything is related to everything else the web of extended interactions seldom is it possible for an action to have only one effect.
Please click on "Bird Feeder Dilemma"^[Bird Feeder Dilemma Model [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8872](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8872)] title and step through the following ILE for an initial sense of how a simple action can impact many things creating a web of relations.

# Model
{"title": "Bird Feeder Dilemma", "description": "All you wanted was a more pleasant morning at breakfast.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8872"}
# End Model

Hopefully this gives you a sense of the difficulty one can get into when simply thinking about a single action taken to achieve a goal without considering the effects of that action. This web of relations provides a limited view as it's only a picture of relations, and probably not all of them. The picture doesn't give you any real sense of the quantity of anything over time.

The "Moose and Wolves"^[Moose and Wolves Model [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8590](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8590)] ILE should provide a sense of why it's important to understand how the web of extended interactions develops over time if we are to really develop a web of understanding.

# Model
{"title": "Moose and Wolves", "description": "How do the populations of Moose and Wolves interact?", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8590"}
# End Model

Was the interaction of the population of Moose and Wolves what you expected? Probably not. It's the nature of a web of interactions over time that we simply can't see by looking at a picture. The behavior over time is often critical for an understanding of what's really happening in the web.

The following "Sustaining the Forest"^[Sustaining the Forest Model [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8889](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8889)] ILE is intended to provid another example of how unexpected the behavior of a web of extended interactions can be.

# Model
{"title": "Sustaining the Forest", "description": "Is the forest you care about sustainable under current practices?", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8889"}
# End Model

Did you find it interesting how unexpected the future can be? Did you sense there was a good reason for things unfolding in the manner they did? As you continue you will develop your skills for understanding interactions in the web.

## Creating the Future ##

Yesterday's actions are responsible for the the world we experience today. And today's actions are responsible for the world that we will experience tomorrow. The "Creating the Future"^[Creating the Future [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8892](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8892)] ILE is intended to provide a better sense of the common process associated with the unexpected unfolding of the future.

# Model
{"title": "Creating the Future", "description": "There is a meaning to it all.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8892"}
# End Model

If this ILE presents a sense of what is essential if you want to address a situation without making things worse the question is how do you get better at doing this. How do you improve the chances of creating the future you're trying to create? All too often the world around us seems so complicated and so apparently difficult to pursue our dreams that we almost want to give up. The answer to complicated is to find the essence within the complicated allowing us to develop a web of understand. The next few sections will specifically address how we get better at this.

## Patterns in the Web ##

What you learn, and your capacity to learn, serves as a basis for everything you do in life. Yet, have you ever really thought about how you learn about the world around you? There are some things you memorize early in life, like the times tables. While you memorize these is that really learning? Do you remember that if you put your hand on something very hot it will burn you, or is that something you learned? And if you learned that, how was it that the learning happened?

The "Follow the Clues"^[Follow the Clues [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8893](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8893)] ILE is intended to provide an insight as to how you actually learn. Later we will also present an introduction as to how you can improve your learning and actually test whether what you have learned is actually correct.

You have most likely come to understand that all refrigerators are not identical. Some have one door with a separate compartment inside. Some have two doors and a drawer. Some are much smaller than others. Some can fit under a counter and some even fit on top of a counter. Some may be so large you can walk into them.

Even when you see different looking refrigerators you quickly decide it's a refrigerator. How does that happen? Gregory Bateson, one of the great thinkers of our time, said, “It’s the pattern that connects.” If you reflect on this statement you should come to realize there are actually different ways to interpret what it means. In this particular case the pattern connects you to the following purpose.

- The box keeps food from readily spoiling by keeping it cold
- Part of the box is a freezer which keeps food from spoiling for even longer

And with this realization you understand it to be a refrigerator. Though now that we've arrived at this understanding we still haven't addressed the question of how you know. You were probably not actually taught that it's the above purpose that represents the essence of a refrigerator. Most people were not, though they have essentially learned it over time.

Patterns in the web are the way we look at, and understand the world around us. All we have are our patterns. They are the way we understand everything. This is so because we build our understanding based on what we already understand. The world around us simply has too much detail for us to pay attention to everything. A refrigerator has many pieces, though how many do you really pay attention to? Probably not many, unless you build or repair refrigerators. We choose what to pay attention to in the world around us, filtering out much of the detail so we don't become overloaded. Sometimes we do this consciously and sometimes we do it subconsciously through experience. In the midst of what we choose to pay attention to there are patterns. Whether we realize it or not it is these patterns that we pay attention to and attempt to make sense of. We understand these patterns by linking them to, and extending, patterns we already understand, while we ignore much of the detail around us.

----------

#### Pattern ####

A pattern is a simplified version of some aspect of the world around us to help us understand something. You may often hear people refer to these patterns as models, or even mental models.

----------

## Learning ##

When we experience something that experience falls somewhere between complete novelty, meaning that we can't connect it with anything in our past experience, and complete confirmation, meaning that it represents something we already believe we completely understand. Experiences which lie somewhere between complete novelty and complete confirmation provide a basis for learning. They represent a basis for connecting to understood patterns, extending those patterns and our understanding, and what results is learning [@Jantsch:1980tr].

Consider running into a refrigerator that looks like no refrigerator you've ever seen before. From an initial view you are unlikely to perceive it as a refrigerator? As you inspect it and find it serves the purpose you've come to understand for refrigerators, or if someone tells you it's a refrigerator, you then expand or extend your awareness of the range of patterns that constitute a refrigerator. And as Bateson said, "It's the pattern that connects."

## A Basis for Flawed Learning ##

While reading the previous paragraphs did it dawn on you that much of this pattern recognition/connection/extension learning doesn't happen consciously? We connect with patterns and extend our knowledge at times without even being consciously aware that it's happening. And when this happens subconsciously there isn't really any critical validation that happens along with the learning. Because this ongoing learning happens without critical validation there are things we learn and come to believe which are actually incorrect. We may have perceived patterns and extended our learning in a flawed manner. The really annoying thing is that we then act on these flawed beliefs, and when we produce results that don't go the way we expected we wonder why. Or even worse, we don't actually learn from the unexpected results and correct the flawed models which served as the basis for our flawed actions.

When we act on flawed beliefs attempting to solve problems we typically create more problems. It has been said repeatedly that the majority of today's problems are the direct result of yesterday's solutions. Shouldn't this provide a sense that we might really benefit from a better way to think about the world around us, develop better understanding, and develop solutions that don't come back to haunt us in the future?

## Simulation ##

While patterns can help us understand the world around us we live in a dynamic ever changing world, where the only real constant is change. Simulations allow us to bring the patterns we build to life and get a sense of the implications of the relations over time. It has been said that we as humans have a very limited capacity to understand the implication of two or more dynamic relations over time. To help us develop our understanding in this area we simulate the patterns we develop. We expect you experienced this with the previous "Moose and Wolves" and "Sustainable Forest" models.

----------

#### Simulation ####

A simulation is the dynamics manipulation of a pattern over time that allows us to understand how the web of extended relations unfolds over time. A simulation essentially does a time compression, or expansion, to allow us to get a sense of the implications of the relations over time, an experience that would otherwise be very difficult to get a sense of.

----------

## New Patterns - A Better Way ##

Ludwig von Bertalanffy first proposed, in 1937, that the same basic structures operated across all disciplines, and if one learned how these structures operated one could transfer much of their learning from one discipline to another [@Davidson:1983uw]. When moving from one discipline to another, one would simply have to learn the structures that were operating, and the labels on the elements of the structures. On first reading this may seem most profound, or maybe even preposterous. However, if you think about it, there may be some truth to it after all.

We're not asking you to simply believe the previous statement. We expect this continued learning experience will shortly reinforce the sensibility of the statement from your own perspective. The next three ILEs are intended to present a set of common properties considered to provide an essence of understanding.

It is expected that "Essence Property # 1^[Essence Property # 1 [http://insightmaker.com/insight/4957](http://insightmaker.com/insight/4957)]" should provide a very different view of the world around you.

# Model
{"title": "Essence Property # 1", "description": "Finding the common among the different.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/4957"}
# End Model

Did you realize that while the structure demonstrates a property of growth that is not a property you can find in any of the individual components. This is what is called an emergent property. All models have one or more emergent properties. Have you ever heard the statement "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"? This is an example of what that statement implies.

~ Exercise

How each of the accumulations in the simulation changes is a bit different, as are the time frames of concern. Time frame being the time it takes for some noticeable change in the accumulation.

Take a few minutes and identify half a dozen situations you're familiar with where there are stocks that increase, or decrease, over time. What are the quantities for those stocks, e.g., gallons, pounds, kilograms, etc? What are the flows that increase or decrease those stocks? What are the time frames over which you think about the increase, or decrease of the stock?

~ End Exercise

The "Essence Property # 1" model presented the concept of a stock which changes based on flows in and flows out. The manner in which the stock changes is independent of the stock itself. The "Essence Property # 2"^[Essence Property # 2 [http://insightmaker.com/insight/4548](http://insightmaker.com/insight/4548)] will present an additional dimension to the previous structure.

# Model
{"title": "Essence Property # 2", "description": "A simple change in structure can have a great impact on the result.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/4548"}
# End Model

The emergent property of this model is exponential growth. A property that cannot be found in any of the elements of the model when separated from the model. Get used to looking for and identifying emergent properties. As you will see they are very important.

~ Exercise

As in the previous exercise take a few minutes and identify a number of situations you are familiar with which demonstrate exponential growth. What are the quantities for the stocks and flows in those situations? What are the time frames for the exponential growth? Once it starts why doesn't the growth continue forever?

~ End Exercise

Exponential growth results from reinforcing feedback from a stock to a flow. The "Essence Property # 3"^[Essence Property # 3 [http://insightmaker.com/insight/6120](http://insightmaker.com/insight/6120)] model will introduce a different type of feedback.

# Model
{"title": "Essence Property # 3", "description": "There is more than one type of feedback.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/6120"}
# End Model

~ Exercise

As in the previous exercise take a few minutes and identify a number of situations you are familiar with which demonstrate goal seeking behavior. What are the quantities for the stocks and flows in those situations? What defines the goal for these situations? What governs the time frame over which the goal is achieved?

~ End Exercise

A goal seeking structure pursues the goal in a manner which depends on balancing feedback. Every goal seeking structure has at least one balancing feedback and every balancing structure has a goal it is tending toward. Goal Seeking is the emergent property of the structure that can't be found in any of the elements of the structure.

## Three Structures ##

You have now experienced the three structures, or models, which will combine in various ways to create every model you ever develop in the future. These three structures are the building blocks out of which everything else is created. No matter how complex or complicated the model may seem, it's simply some number of these three structures interacting. These three structures are presented together in the "Similar Structures / Different Behavior"^[Similar Structures / Different Behavior [http://insightmaker.com/insight/5138](http://insightmaker.com/insight/5138)] model so you can experience them together for reinforcement.

# Model
{"title": "Similar Structures / Different Behavior", "description": "The behavior of a model depends on its structure and the formulas that define the nature of the relationships.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/5138"}
# End Model

Hopefully you have become comfortable with these three structures as you will experience them over and over. If you're not comfortable please interact with the previous models until you are.

## Three Types of Models ##

In previous sections you interacted with two different kinds of models qualitative models, i.e., no numbers, "Follow the Clues" and "Bird Feeder Dilemma" and quantitative models, with numbers, all the simulation models you ran. In the "Three Types of Models"^[Three Types of Models [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8932](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8932)] ILE we'll present two types of qualitative models, Rich Pictures and Causal Loop Diagrams, and more detail about quantitative Stock & Flow Simulation Models.

# Model
{"title": "Three Types of Models", "description": "Though there are different types of models each may contribute to understanding is a particular way.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8932"}
# End Model

Which type of model you develop depends on what you're trying to understand and how you intend to use the model after you develop it. At times you may even use multiple types of models. You may use a rich picture to get an initial sense of the interactions, then develop a simulation model and finally use a causal loop diagram to present the insights identified to others. It's of critical importance to consider the intent and your audience when you set out to create a model. That's not to say the intent may not change along the way. The development of models should be considered, above all else, a learning process.

## Construction Process ##

While there are an endless array of possible reasons for constructing a model, it all boils down to learning and understanding. The "Model Construction Process"^[Model Construction Process [http://insightmaker.com/insight/184](http://insightmaker.com/insight/184)] model is intended to present the essence of all model development.

# Model
{"title": "Model Construction Process", "description": "Regardless of the specific purpose the overall intent is always the same.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/184"}
# End Model

It is hoped that this model reinforces the idea that models can cut through all the confusion and present the essence of a set of interactions to provide a consistent understanding. Can you see this essence in the models that have been developed to this point?

## The Essence of AND? ##

Developing models is actually the easy part. What you should strive for is developing models that advance your understanding and allow you to surface insights to better address situations around you. Evolving a model to surface insights can be a relatively straightforward and simple process which we hope is conveyed by the following "The Essence of AND?"^[The Essence of AND? [http://insightmaker.com/insight/3365](http://insightmaker.com/insight/3365)] model.

# Model
{"title": "The Essence of AND?", "description": "Continuing to seek out the relevant influences lies in asking a single question, AND?", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/3365"}
# End Model

The process presented can be used with Rich Pictures or Causal Loop Diagrams as well as Stock & Flow Simulations. When developing Stock & Flow Simulations you also have to be certain that the model runs and produces a meaningful result. When developing a simulation you should never be more than a couple clicks away from a working model. You'll better understand this advice after you make a substantial number of changes to a working model, it then doesn't run, and you spend hours trying to figure out how you broke it. Do yourself a favor, think about what the changed should produce, run after every change and verify the model produces what you expect. It only takes a minute. And when the simulation doesn't produce what you expect it's not a problem, it's an opportunity for learning.

## Modeling Guidelines ##

There are a number of guidelines or rules of thumb that you will find helpful when developing a model. These are presented in the following "Modeling Guidelines"^[Modeling Guidelines [http://insightmaker.com/insight/1784](http://insightmaker.com/insight/1784)] model. The idea is to ensure that the model serves the purpose you started building it for. Some of these guidelines are only relevant to Stock & Flow simulations. Which are which should be quite obvious.

# Model

# End Model

Remember, model development and the understanding that comes with it is an iterative process. It's almost impossible to create all the pieces as they should be the first time around. Look at it as do a little, learn a little, and repeat.

## Summary ##

- Models are simplified versions of the world around us.
- We build models to help us understand and learn.
- We build simple models and add to them as we learn with them.
- Building models and learning is an iterative process.
- We learn as we go and seldom do we get models right the first time.
- Feedback Independent, Reinforcing and Balancing structures are the basic building blocks for all models.
- These building blocks can aid in understanding aspects of our interactions with the world around us.
- Stock & Flow, Rich Picture, and Causal Loop models are only three of a very large array of possible modeling forms that exist. Use them to the extent that they serve you and when they don't find a form that does.
- Use a modeling form that adequately serves your quest for understanding.
- Simulations are dynamic models that help us understand changes over time.
- The Model Thinking Course by Scott E. Page presents a very extensive exposure to many types of models useful for understanding different aspects of the world around us.

### Rich Pictures ###

- Often easier for others to relate to and understand because of the images in the model.
- No rules for creating them though remember that you need to tell a story.
- Because you need to tell a story make the model as understandable as possible.

### Causal Loop Diagrams ###

- Specific Guidelines for how to depict the relationships between the elements.
- Color coding relations is an alternative to the + and - notation, though be consistent.
- Employing explicit stock representations often reduces misinterpretations.
- Hybrid Rich Pictures/Causal Loop Diagrams are often the very meaningful.

### Stock & Flow Simulations ###

- The most explicit model form with well defined rules for construction that must be followed.
- The dynamic nature allows you to compress time and distance to see the implications of relations.

### Construction Process

- Use a process that suits you and the purpose you're trying to achieve.

### Guidelines ###

- The guidelines are intended to help you develop better models.
- Use the guidelines as a checklist.

Please continue to the next chapter where you will learn more about working though the development of models.
