“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where–” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
“–so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation.
“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”

The world we live in is much like a giant spider web where everything is connected to everything else. When something changes in one part of the web it ripples though the whole web. We tend to live in the moment not realizing how actions ripple over time thorough distant parts of the web. When we don't understand the web things around us tend to seem extremely complicated, confusing and overwhelming. We feel caught in the web. What we need is a web of understanding for this web of extended interactions around us.

It has been said that you can learn about riding a bicycle from reading a book though to learn to ride a bicycle you actually have to spend time on the bicycle. The interactive learning environments (ILEs) you're about to experience are intended to develop a web of understanding for the web of extended interactions around you. You are encouraged to engage with the ILEs as the understanding you develop will aid you in figuring out where you want to get to and develop skills which will improve your likelihood of getting there.

## Experiencing the Web ##

Please click on the title and step through the following ILE for an initial sense of how a simple action can impact many things in the web of relations.

# Model

{"title": "Bird Feeder Dilemma", "description": "All I wanted was a more pleasant morning breakfast.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8872"}

# End Model

Hopefully this gives you a sense of difficulty one can get into when simply thinking about a single action taken to achieve a goal without considering the effects of that action. This web provides a limited view as it's only a picture of relations. The picture doesn't give you any real sense of the quantity of anything over time. The next ILE should provide a better sense of why it's important to have a sense of how the web of extended interactions develops over time if we are to really develop a web of understand.

# Model

{"title": "Moose and Wolves", "description": "The populations of Moose and Wolves are dynamically linked.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8590"}

# End Model

Was the interaction of the population of Moose and Wolves what you expected? Probably not. It's the nature of a web of interactions over time that we simply can't see by looking at a picture. The behavior over time is often critical for a sense of what's really happening in the web.

The following ILE is provided as another example of how unexpected the behavior of a web of extended interactions can be over time.

# Model

{"title": "Sustaining the Forest", "description": "Is the forest you care about sustainable with current practices?", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8889"}

# End Model

Did you find it interesting how unexpected the future can be? Did you sense there was a good reason for things unfolding in the manner they did in the web? As you continue you will develop a skill for understanding in interactions in the web.

## The Future We Create ##

The next ILE is intended to provide a better sense of the detail associated with the unexpected unfolding of the future.

# Model

{"title": "Creating the Future.", "description": "There is a meaning to it all.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8892"}

# End Model

This ILE presents a sense of what what you are doing any time you set out to do anything. Based on past experience the question is how do you get better at doing this to improve the chances of creating the future you're trying to create?

All too often the world around us seems so complicated and apparently so difficult to pursue our dreams that we almost want to give up. The answer to complicated is to simplify the complicated and understand complexity. This will happen in very short order.

## Patterns in Complexity ##

What you learn, and your capacity to learn, serves as a basis for everything you do in life. Yet, have you ever really thought about how you learn about the world around you? There are some things you memorize early in life, like the times tables. While you memorize these is that really learning? Do you remember that if you put your hand on something very hot it will burn you, or is that something you learned? And if you learned that, how was it that the learning happened? In this chapter we will investigate how you actually learn. We will also present a introduction to how you can improve your learning and actually test whether what you have learned is actually correct.

You have most likely come to understand that all refrigerators are not identical. Some have one door with a separate compartment inside. Some have two doors and a drawer. Some are much smaller than others. Some can fit under a counter and some even fit on top of a counter. Some can be so large you can walk into them.

Even when you see different looking refrigerators you quickly decide it's a refrigerator. How does that happen? Gregory Bateson, one of the great thinkers of our time, said, “It’s the pattern that connects.” If you reflect on this statement you should come to realize there are actually different ways to interpret what it means. In this particular case the pattern connects you to the following purpose

- The box keeps food from readily spoiling by keeping it cold
- Part of the box is a freezer which keeps food from spoiling for even longer

and you understand it to be a refrigerator. Though now that we've arrived at this point we still haven't addressed the question of how you know. You were probably not actually taught that it's the above purpose that defines the essence of a refrigerator. Most people were not, though they have essentially learned it over time.

Patterns in the web are the way we look at, and understand the world around us. All we have are our patterns. They are the way we understand everything. This is so because we build our understanding based on what we already understand. The world around us simply has too much detail for us to pay attention to everything. A refrigerator has many pieces though how many do you really pay attention to? Probably not many unless you build or repair refrigerators. We choose what to pay attention to in the world around us and we filter out much of the detail so we don't become overloaded. Sometimes we do this consciously and sometimes we do it subconsciously though experience. In the midst of what we choose to pay attention to there are patterns. Whether we realize it or not it is these patterns that we pay attention to and attempt to make sense of. We understand these patterns by linking them to extend patterns we already understand while we ignore much of the detail around us.

----------

#### Pattern ####

A pattern is a simplified version of some aspect of the world around us to help us understand something. You may often hear people refer to these patterns as models.

----------

## Learning ##

When we experience something that experience falls somewhere between complete novelty, meaning that we can't connect it with anything in our past experience, and complete confirmation, meaning that it represents something we already completely understand. Experiences which lie somewhere between complete novelty and complete confirmation provide a basis for learning. They represent a basis for connecting to understood patterns, extending those patterns and our understanding, and what results is learning. {Cite: Jantach, Eric. 1980. The Self-Organizing Universe: Scientific and Human Implications. Pergamon Press. http://www.amazon.com/The-Self-Organizing-Universe-Implications-Innovations/dp/0080243118/}

Consider running into a refrigerator that looks like no refrigerator you've ever seen before. From an initial view you are unlikely to perceive it as a refrigerator. As you inspect it and find it serves the purpose you've come to understand for refrigerators, or if someone tells you it's a refrigerator, you then expand or extend your awareness of the range of patterns that constitute a refrigerator. And as Bateson said, "It's the pattern that connects."

## A Basis for Flawed Learning ##

While reading the previous paragraphs did it dawn on you that much of this pattern recognition/connection/extension learning doesn't happen consciously? We connect with patterns and extend our knowledge at times without even being consciously aware that it is happening. And when this happens subconsciously there isn't really any critical validation that happens along with the learning. Because this ongoing learning happens without critical validation there are things we learn and come to believe which are actually incorrect. We have perceived patterns and extended our learning in a flawed manner. The really annoying thing is that we then act on these beliefs, and when we produce results that don't go the way we planned we wonder why. Or even worse, we don't actually learn from the results and correct the flawed models which served as the basis for our flawed actions.

When we act on flawed beliefs attempting to solve problems we typically create more problems. It has been said repeatedly that the majority of today's problems are the direct result of yesterday's solutions. Wouldn't this provide a sense that we might really benefit from a better way to think about the world around us, develop better understanding, and develop solutions that don't come back to haunt us in the future?

## Simulation ##

While patterns can help us understand the world around us we live in a dynamic ever changing world, where the only real constant is change. Simulations allow us to bring the patterns we build to life and get a sense of the implications of the relations over time. It has been said that we as humans have a very limited capacity to understand the implication of two or more dynamic relations over time. To help us develop our understanding in this area we simulate the patterns we develop.

----------

#### Simulation ####

A simulation is the dynamics manipulation of a pattern over time that allows us to understand how the web of extended relations unfolds over time. A simulation essentially does a time compression, or expansion, to allow us to get a sense of the implications of the relations over time, an experience that would otherwise be very difficult to get a sense of.

## New Patterns - A Better Way - ##

Ludwig von Bertalanffy first proposed, in 1937, that the same basic structures operated across all disciplines, and if one learned how these structures operated one could transfer much of their learning from one discipline to another.{Davidson, Mark. 1983. Uncommon Sense: The Life and Thought of Ludwig von Bertalanffy. J.P. Tarcher, Inc. http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Sense-Thought-Bertalanffy-1901-1972/dp/087477165X/} When moving from one discipline to another, one would simply have to learn the structures that were operating, and the labels on the elements of the structures. On first reading this may seem most profound, or maybe even preposterous. However, if you think about it, maybe there is some truth to it after all.

We're not simply asking you to believe the previous statement though this continued learning experience is expected to reinforce the sensibility of the statement from your own perspective. And it is hoped that the next ILE should provide the first hint of that.

# Model

{"title": "Simplifying Everything", "description": "Finding the common among the different.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/4957"}

# End Model

~ Exercise

How each of the accumulations in the simulation changes is a bit different, as are the time frames of concern. Time frame being the time it takes for some noticeable change in the accumulation.

Take a few minutes and identify half a dozen situations you're familiar with where there are stocks that increase, or decrease, over time. What are the quantities for those stocks, e.g., gallons, pounds, kilograms, etc? What are the flows that increase or decrease those stocks? What are the time frames over which you think about the increase, or decrease of the stock?

~ End Exercise

The previous ILE presented the concept of a stock which changes based on flows in and flows out. The manner in which the stock changes is independent of the stock itself. The next ILE will present an additional dimension to the previous structure.

# Model

{"title": "Common Property # 1", "description": "A simple change can have a great impact on the result.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/4548"}

# End Model

~ Exercise

As in the previous exercise take a few minutes and identify a number of situations you are familiar with which are represented by the model just presented. What are the quantities for the stocks and flows in those situations?

~ End Exercise

Now that you have a sense of the implications of reinforcing feedback on the behavior of a stock, the next ILE will introduce a very different perspective of feedback.

# Model

{"title": "Common Property # 2", "description": "And there is an alternative.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/6120"}

# End Model

~ Exercise

As in the previous exercise take a few minutes and identify a number of situations you are familiar with which are represented by the model just presented. What re the quantities for the stocks and flows in those situations?

~ End Exercise

A goal seeking structure pursues the goal in a manner which depends on balancing feedback. Every goal seeking structure has one or more balancing feedback and every balancing structure has a goal it is tending toward.

You have now experienced the three structures, or models, which will combine in various ways to create every model you ever create in the future. Those three structures are the building blocks out of which everything else is created. No matter how complex or complicated the model may seem, it is simply some number of these three structures interacting. These three structures are presented together in the following ILE so you can experience them together for reinforcement.

# Model

{"title": "Similar Structures / Different Behavior", "description": "The behavior of a model depends on the structure as well as the formulas that define the nature of the relationships.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/5138"}

# End Model

## Summary ##

- Models are simplified versions of the world around us.
- Simulations are dynamic models that help us understand changes over time.
- We build models to help us understand and learn.
- We build simple models and add to them as we learn with them.
- Building models and learning is an iterative process.
- We learn as we go and seldom do we get models right the first time.
- Linear, Reinforcing and Balancing structures are the basic building blocks for all models.
- These building blocks can aid in understanding aspects of our interactions with the world around us.

Please continue to the next chapter where you will learn more about the Insight Maker environment so you can actually build the models that were presented in this chapter.
