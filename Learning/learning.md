“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where–” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
“–so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation.
“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”

We live in a world much like a giant spider web, where everything is connected to everything else. When something changes in one part of the web it ripples though the entire web. We tend to live in the moment, not realizing how our actions ripple over time through distant parts of the web. When we don't understand the web, things around us seem extremely complicated, confusing, and overwhelming. We feel caught in the web. What we need is a web of understanding for this web of extended interactions.

It has been said that you can learn about riding a bicycle from reading a book, though to learn to ride a bicycle you actually have to spend time on a bicycle. The interactive learning environments (ILE) you're about to experience are intended to develop a web of understanding for the web of extended interactions around you. You are encouraged to engage with these ILEs. The understanding you develop will help you determine where you want to get to and develop skills to improve your chances of getting there. These ILEs are very much like reading a book about riding a bicycle as you're actually on the bicycle learning to ride it. Enjoy the experience and the learning.

## Experiencing the Web ##

Because everything is related to everything else in the web of extended interactions, seldom is it possible for an action to have only one effect.
Please click on the "Bird Feeder Dilemma"^[Bird Feeder Dilemma Model [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8872](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8872)] title and step through the ILE. This will give you an initial sense of how a simple action can impact many things, creating a web of extended interactions.

# Model
{"title": "Bird Feeder Dilemma", "description": "All you wanted was a more pleasant morning at breakfast.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8872"}
# End Model

Do you get a sense of the troubles you can get into when you think about a single action taken to achieve a goal without considering the effects of that action? This web of relations provides a limited view, as it's only a picture of relations, and probably not all of the possible relations. 

The picture doesn't give you any real sense of the quantity of anything over time and there are times when a picture simply can not provide the level of understanding about a situation needed. The "Moose and Wolves"^[Moose and Wolves Model [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8590](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8590)] ILE should provide a sense of why it's important to understand how the web of extended interactions develops over time if we are to really develop a web of understanding.

# Model
{"title": "Moose and Wolves", "description": "How do the populations of Moose and Wolves interact?", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8590"}
# End Model

Was the interaction of the population of Moose and Wolves what you expected? Probably not. It's the nature of a web of interactions over time that we simply can't see by looking at a picture. The behavior over time is often critical for an understanding of what's really happening in the web.

Consider the following "Sustaining the Forest"^[Sustaining the Forest Model [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8889](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8889)] ILE intended to provide another example of how unexpected the behavior of a web of extended interactions can be.

# Model
{"title": "Sustaining the Forest", "description": "Is the forest you care about sustainable under current practices?", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8889"}
# End Model

Did you find it interesting how unexpected the future can be? Did you sense there was a good reason for things unfolding in the manner they did? As you continue you will develop your skills for understanding interactions in the web.

## Creating the Future ##

Yesterday's actions are responsible for the the world we experience today. And today's actions are responsible for the world that we will experience tomorrow. The "Creating the Future"^[Creating the Future [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8892](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8892)] ILE is intended to provide a better sense of the common process associated with the unexpected unfolding of the future.

# Model
{"title": "Creating the Future", "description": "There is meaning to it all.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8892"}
# End Model

If this ILE presents the elements essential to addressing a situation without making things worse, how do you get better at doing this? How do you improve your chances of creating the future you're trying to create? All too often the world around us seems so complicated. Pursuit of our dreams can be so apparently difficult that we almost want to give up. The answer is to find the essence within the complicated, allowing us to develop a web of understanding. The next few sections will specifically address how we get better at this.

## Patterns in the Web ##

What you learn, and your capacity to learn, serves as a basis for everything you do in life. Yet, have you ever really thought about how you learn about the world around you? There are some things you memorize early in life, like the times tables. Is memorizing really learning? You know if you put your hand on something very hot it will burn you. Do you remember that, or did you learn it? And if you learned it, how did the learning happened?

The "Follow the Clues"^[Follow the Clues [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8893](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8893)] ILE is intended to provide an insight as to how you actually learn. Later we will also introduce concepts on improving your learning, and actually test whether what you have learned is really correct.

You have most likely come to understand that all refrigerators are not identical. Some have one door with a separate compartment inside. Some have two doors and a drawer. Some are much smaller than others. Some can fit under a counter and some even fit on top of a counter. Some may be so large you can walk into them.

Even when you see different looking refrigerators you quickly decide it's a refrigerator. How does that happen? Gregory Bateson, one of the great thinkers of our time, said, “It’s the pattern that connects.” If you reflect on this statement you should come to realize there are actually different ways to interpret what it means. In this particular case the pattern connects you to the following purposes of a refrigerator.

- The box keeps food from readily spoiling by keeping it cold
- Part of the box is a freezer that keeps food from spoiling for even longer

And with this realization you understand it to be a refrigerator. Though now that we've arrived at this understanding we still haven't addressed the question of how you know. You were probably not actually taught that the above purpose represents the essence of a refrigerator. Most people were not, though they have essentially learned it over time.

Patterns in the web are the way we look at and understand the world around us. All we have are our patterns. They are the way we understand everything. This is so because we build our understanding based on what we already understand. The world around us simply has too much detail for us to pay attention to everything. A refrigerator has many pieces, though how many do you really pay attention to? Probably not many, unless you build or repair refrigerators. We choose what to pay attention to in the world around us, filtering out much of the detail so we don't become overloaded. Sometimes we do this consciously and sometimes we do it subconsciously through experience. In the midst of what we choose to pay attention to there are patterns. Whether we realize it or not, it is these patterns that we pay attention to and attempt to make sense of. We understand these patterns by linking them to, and extending patterns we already understand, while we ignore much of the detail around us.

----------

#### Pattern ####

A pattern is a simplified version of some aspect of the world around us to help us understand something. You may often hear people refer to these patterns as models, or even mental models.

----------

## Learning ##

When we experience something, that experience falls somewhere between complete novelty, meaning that we can't connect it with anything in our past experience, and complete confirmation, meaning that it represents something we already believe we completely understand. Experiences which lie somewhere between complete novelty and complete confirmation provide a basis for learning. They represent a basis for connecting to understood patterns and extending those patterns and our understanding. What results is learning [@Jantsch:1980tr].

Consider running into a refrigerator that looks like no refrigerator you've ever seen before. From an initial view you are unlikely to perceive it as a refrigerator. As you inspect it and find it serves the purpose you've come to understand for refrigerators, or if someone tells you it's a refrigerator, you then expand or extend your awareness of the range of patterns that constitute a refrigerator. And as Bateson said, "It's the pattern that connects."

## A Basis for Flawed Learning ##

While reading the previous paragraphs did it dawn on you that much of this pattern recognition/connection/extension learning doesn't happen consciously? We connect with patterns and extend our knowledge at times without even being aware that it's happening. And when this happens subconsciously there is no critical validation to accompany the learning. Because this ongoing learning happens without critical validation, there are things we learn - and come to believe - that are actually incorrect. We may have perceived patterns and extended our learning in a flawed manner. The really annoying thing is that we then act on these flawed beliefs, and when we produce results that don't go the way we expected, we wonder why. Or even worse, we don't actually learn from the unexpected results and correct the flawed models that served as the basis for our flawed actions.

When we try to solve problems based on flawed beliefs we typically create more problems. It has been said repeatedly that the majority of today's problems are the direct result of yesterday's solutions. Shouldn't this provide a sense that we might really benefit from a better way to think about the world around us, develop better understanding, and develop solutions that don't come back to haunt us in the future?

## Simulation ##

While patterns can help us understand the world around us, we live in a dynamic and ever changing world in which the only real constant is change. Simulations allow us to bring the patterns we build to life and get a sense of the implications of the relations over time. It has been said that we as humans have a very limited capacity to understand the implication of two or more dynamic relations over time. To help us develop our understanding in this area we simulate the patterns we develop. Perhaps you experienced this with the previous "Moose and Wolves" and "Sustainable Forest" models.

----------

#### Simulation ####

A simulation is the dynamic manipulation of a pattern over time that allows us to understand how the web of extended relations unfolds over time. A simulation essentially does a time compression (or expansion) to allow us to consider the implications of the relations over time, an experience that would otherwise be very difficult to understand.

----------

## New Patterns - A Better Way ##

In 1937 Ludwig von Bertalanffy first proposed that the same basic structures operated across all disciplines. He suggested that if a person learned how these structures operated they could transfer much of their learning from one discipline to another [@Davidson:1983uw]. When moving from one discipline to another, one would simply have to learn the structures that were operating, and the labels on the elements of the structures. On first reading this may seem most profound, or maybe even preposterous. However, if you think about it, there may be some truth to it after all.

We're not asking you to simply believe the previous statement. We expect this continued learning experience will reinforce the logic of this statement from your own perspective. The set of common properties presented in the next three ILEs are considered to provide an essence of understanding.

"Essence Property # 1^[Essence Property # 1 [http://insightmaker.com/insight/4957](http://insightmaker.com/insight/4957)]" should provide a very different view of the world around you.

# Model
{"title": "Essence Property # 1", "description": "Finding the common among the different.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/4957"}
# End Model

Did you realize that while the structure demonstrates a property of growth, growth is not a property you can find in any of the individual components? This is what is called an emergent property. All models have one or more emergent properties. Have you ever heard the statement "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts"? This is an example of what that statement implies.

~ Exercise
Each of the accumlations in the simulation changes in a different way. The timeframes of concern are also different (timeframe being the time it takes for a noticeable change in the accumlation).

Take a few minutes and identify half a dozen situations you're familiar with where there are stocks that increase or decrease over time. What are the values for those stocks, e.g., gallons, pounds, kilograms, etc.? What are the flows that increase or decrease those stocks? What are the timeframes over which you think about the increase or decrease of the stock?
~ End Exercise

"Essence Property # 1" presented the concept of a stock that changes based on flows in and flows out. The manner in which the stock changes is independent of the stock itself. The "Essence Property # 2"^[Essence Property # 2 [http://insightmaker.com/insight/4548](http://insightmaker.com/insight/4548)] will present an additional dimension to the previous structure.

# Model
{"title": "Essence Property # 2", "description": "A simple change in structure can have a great impact on its behavior.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/4548"}
# End Model

The emergent property of this model is exponential growth; a property that cannot be found in any of the elements of the model when separated from the model. Get used to looking for and identifying emergent properties. You should come to realize they are very important.

~ Exercise
As in the previous exercise, take a few minutes and identify a number of situations you are familiar with that demonstrate exponential growth. What are the values for the stocks and flows in those situations? What are the timeframes for the exponential growth? Once it starts why doesn't the growth continue forever?
~ End Exercise

Exponential growth results from reinforcing feedback from a stock to a flow. The "Essence Property # 3"^[Essence Property # 3 [http://insightmaker.com/insight/6120](http://insightmaker.com/insight/6120)] model will introduce a different type of feedback.

# Model
{"title": "Essence Property # 3", "description": "There is more than one type of feedback.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/6120"}
# End Model

~ Exercise
As in the previous exercise, take a few minutes and identify a number of situations you are familiar with that demonstrate goal seeking behavior. What are the values for the stocks and flows in those situations? What defines the goal for these situations? What governs the timeframe over which the goal is achieved?
~ End Exercise

A goal seeking structure pursues the goal in a manner that depends on balancing feedback. Every goal seeking structure has at least one balancing feedback and every balancing structure is tending toward a goal. Goal seeking is the emergent property of the structure that can't be found in any of the elements of the structure.

## Three Structures ##

You have now experienced the three structures, or models, which will combine in various ways to create every model you ever develop in the future. These three structures are the building blocks from which everything else is created. No matter how complex or complicated a model may seem, it's simply some number of these three structures interacting. These three structures are presented together in the "Similar Structures / Different Behavior"^[Similar Structures / Different Behavior [http://insightmaker.com/insight/5138](http://insightmaker.com/insight/5138)] model so you can experience them together for reinforcement.

# Model
{"title": "Similar Structures / Different Behavior", "description": "The behavior of a model depends on its structure and the formulas that define the nature of the relationships.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/5138"}
# End Model

Hopefully you have become comfortable with these three structures, as you will experience them over and over. If you're not comfortable please interact with the previous models until you are.

~ Exercise
The best way to determine the extent to which you understand these three structures is to explain them to someone else. You might want to actually use the models presented to achieve this.
~ End Exercise

## Three Types of Models ##

In previous sections you interacted with two different kinds of modelsin all the simulation models you ran: qualitative models (no numbers - "Follow the Clues" and "Bird Feeder Dilemma") and quantitative models (with numbers). In the "Three Types of Models"^[Three Types of Models [http://insightmaker.com/insight/8932](http://insightmaker.com/insight/8932)] ILE we'll present two types of qualitative models: Rich Pictures and Causal Loop Diagrams. We will also provide more detail about quantitative Stock & Flow Simulation Models.

# Model
{"title": "Three Types of Models", "description": "Though there are different types of models each may contribute to understanding is a particular way.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8932"}
# End Model

The type of model you develop depends on what you're trying to understand and how you intend to use the model after you develop it. At times you may even use multiple types of models. You may use a rich picture to get an initial sense of the interactions, then develop a simulation model, and finally use a causal loop diagram to present to others the insights identified. It's of critical importance to consider the intent and your audience when you set out to create a model. That's not to say the intent may not change along the way. The development of models should be considered, above all else, as a learning process.

## Construction Process ##

While there are endless reasons for constructing a model, it all boils down to learning and understanding. The "Model Construction Process"^[Model Construction Process [http://insightmaker.com/insight/184](http://insightmaker.com/insight/184)] model is intended to present the essence of all model development.

# Model
{"title": "Model Construction Process", "description": "Regardless of the specific purpose the overall intent is always the same.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/184"}
# End Model

This model should reinforce the idea that models can cut through all the confusion and present the essence of a set of interactions to provide a consistent understanding. Can you see this essence in the models that have been developed to this point?

## The Essence of AND? ##

Developing models is actually the easy part. What you should strive for is developing models that advance your understanding and allow you to surface insights to better address situations around you. Evolving a model to surface insights can be a relatively straightforward and simple process, which we hope is conveyed by the following "The Essence of AND?"^[The Essence of AND? [http://insightmaker.com/insight/3365](http://insightmaker.com/insight/3365)] model.

# Model
{"title": "The Essence of AND?", "description": "Continuing to seek out the relevant influences lies in asking a single question, AND?", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/3365"}
# End Model

The process presented can be used with Rich Pictures or Causal Loop Diagrams as well as Stock & Flow Simulations. When developing Stock & Flow Simulations you also have to be certain that the model runs and produces a meaningful result. When developing a simulation you should never be more than a couple of clicks away from a working model. You'll better understand this advice through experience. After you've made a substantial number of changes to a working model, it then didn't run, and you've spent hours trying to figure out how you broke it you'll see what we mean. Do yourself a favor: think about what the changes should produce, run after every change, and verify that the model produces what you expected. It only takes a minute. And when the simulation doesn't produce what you expect, it's not a problem, it's an opportunity for learning.

## Modeling Guidelines ##

There are a number of guidelines, or rules of thumb, that you will find helpful when developing a model. These are presented in the following "Modeling Guidelines"^[Modeling Guidelines [http://insightmaker.com/insight/1784](http://insightmaker.com/insight/1784)] model. The idea is to ensure that the model serves the purpose for which you started building it. Some of these guidelines are only relevant for Stock & Flow simulations; these should be quite obvious.

# Model

# End Model

Remember, model development and associated understanding is an iterative process. It's almost impossible to create all the pieces as they should be the first time around.  Do a little, learn a little, and repeat.

## Summary ##

- Models are simplified versions of the world around us.
- We build models to help us understand and learn.
- We build simple models and add to them as we learn with them.
- Building models and learning is an iterative process.
- We learn as we go and seldom do we get models right the first time.
- Feedback Independent Growth, Exponential Growth (Reinforcing Feedback) and Goal Seeking (Balancing Feedback) structures are the basic building blocks for all models.
- These building blocks can aid in understanding aspects of our interactions with the world around us.
- Stock & Flow, Rich Picture, and Causal Loop models are only three of a very large array of possible modeling forms that exist. Use them to the extent that they serve you, and when they don't, find a form that does.
- Use a modeling form that adequately serves your quest for understanding.
- Simulations are dynamic models that help us understand changes over time.
- The [Model Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/course/modelthinking) Course by Scott E. Page presents a very extensive exposure to many types of models useful for understanding different aspects of the world around us.

### Rich Pictures ###

- Often easier for others to relate to and understand because of the images in the model.
- No rules for creating them, though remember that you need to tell a story.
- Because you need to tell a story make the model as understandable as possible.

### Causal Loop Diagrams ###

- Specific Guidelines for how to depict the relationships between the elements.
- Color coding relations is an alternative to the + and - notation, but be consistent.
- Employing explicit stock representations often reduces misinterpretations.
- Hybrid Rich Pictures/Causal Loop Diagrams are often the very meaningful.

### Stock & Flow Simulations ###

- The most explicit model form with well defined rules for construction that must be followed.
- The dynamic nature allows you to compress or expand time and distance to see the implications of relations.

### Construction Process ###

- Use a process that suits you and the purpose you're trying to achieve.

### Guidelines ###

- The guidelines are intended to help you develop better models.
- Use the guidelines as a checklist.

Please continue to the next chapter where you will learn more about working though the development of models.
