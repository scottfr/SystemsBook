# It's The Pattern That Connects #

“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don’t much care where–” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.
“–so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation.
“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”

The interactive learning experience which follows is very much about figuring out where you want to get to, and developing skills to improve your likelihood of getting there. Please open the following model and walk through it to get a sense of the adventure to follow.

Hope you found it interesting how unexpected the future can be. Though we also hope you realized there was a good reason for things unfolding in the manner they did.

All too often the world around us seems so complicated and apparently so difficult to pursue our dreams that we almost want to give up. The answer to complicated is to simplify the complicated and understand complexity. This will happen in very short order.

It has been said that you can learn about riding a bicycle from reading a book though to learn to ride a bicycle you actually have to spend time on the bicycle. Please experience the next model.

Take a few minutes and identify half a dozen situations you're familiar with where there are stocks that increase, or decrease, over time. What are the quantities for those stocks, e.g., gallons, pounds, kilograms, etc? What are the flows that increase or decrease those stocks? What are the time frames over which you think about the increase, or decrease of the stock?

## Patterns ##

What you learn, and your capacity to learn, serves as a basis for everything you do in life. Yet, have you ever really thought about how you learn about the world around you? There are some things you memorize early in life, like the times tables. While you memorize these is that really learning? Do you remember that if you put your hand on something very hot it will burn you, or is that something you learned? And if you learned that, how was it that the learning happened? In this chapter we will investigate how you actually learn. We will also present a introduction to how you can improve your learning and actually test whether what you have learned is actually correct.

You have most likely come to understand that all refrigerators are not identical. Some have one door with a separate compartment inside. Some have two doors and a drawer. Some are much smaller than others. Some can fit under a counter and some even fit on top of a counter. Some can be so large you can walk into them.

Even when you see different looking refrigerators you quickly decide it's a refrigerator. How does that happen? Gregory Bateson, one of the great thinkers of our time, said, “It’s the pattern that connects.” If you reflect on this statement you should come to realize there are actually different ways to interpret what it means. In this particular case the pattern connects you to the following purpose

- The box keeps food from readily spoiling by keeping it cold
- Part of the box is a freezer which keeps food from spoiling for even longer

and you understand it to be a refrigerator. Though now that we've arrived at this point we still haven't addressed the question of how you know. You were probably not actually taught that it's the above purpose that defines the essence of a refrigerator. Most people were not, though they have essentially learned it over time.

## Models ##

Models are the way we look at, and understand the world around us. All we have are our models. They are the way we understand everything. This is so because we build our understanding based on what we already understand. The world around us simply has too much detail for us to pay attention to everything. A refrigerator has many pieces though how many do you really pay attention to? Probably not many unless you build or repair refrigerators. We choose what to pay attention to in the world around us and we filter out much of the detail so we don't become overloaded. Sometimes we do this consciously and sometimes we do it subconsciously though experience. In the midst of what we choose to pay attention to there are patterns. Whether we realize it or not it is these patterns that we pay attention to and attempt to make sense of. We understand these patterns by linking them to extend patterns we already understand while we ignore much of the detail around us.

----------

#### Model ####

A model is a simplified version of some aspect of the world around us to help us understand something.

## Learning ##

When we experience something that experience falls somewhere between complete novelty, meaning that we can't connect it with anything in our past experience, and complete confirmation, meaning that it represents something we already completely understand. Experiences which lie somewhere between complete novelty and complete confirmation provide a basis for learning. They represent a basis for connecting to understood patterns, extending those patterns and our understanding, and what results is learning. {Cite: Jantach, Eric. 1980. The Self-Organizing Universe: Scientific and Human Implications. Pergamon Press. http://www.amazon.com/The-Self-Organizing-Universe-Implications-Innovations/dp/0080243118/}

Consider running into a refrigerator that looks like no refrigerator you've ever seen before. From an initial view you are unlikely to perceive it as a refrigerator. As you inspect it and find it serves the purpose you've come to understand for refrigerators, or if someone tells you it's a refrigerator, you then expand or extend your awareness of the range of patterns that constitute a refrigerator. And as Bateson said, "It's the pattern that connects."

## A Basis for Flawed Learning ##

While reading the previous paragraphs did it dawn on you that much of this pattern recognition/connection/extension learning doesn't happen consciously? We connect with patterns and extend our knowledge at times without even being consciously aware that it is happening. And when this happens subconsciously there isn't really any critical validation that happens along with the learning. Because this ongoing learning happens without critical validation there are things we learn and come to believe which are actually incorrect. We have perceived patterns and extended our learning in a flawed manner. The really annoying thing is that we then act on these beliefs, and when we produce results that don't go the way we planned we wonder why. Or even worse, we don't actually learn from the results and correct the flawed models which served as the basis for our flawed actions.

When we act on flawed beliefs attempting to solve problems we typically create more problems. It has been said repeatedly that the majority of today's problems are the direct result of yesterday's solutions. Wouldn't this provide a sense that we might really benefit from a better way to think about the world around us, develop better understanding, and develop solutions that don't come back to haunt us in the future?

## Simulations ##

While models can help us understand the world around us we live in a dynamic ever changing world, where the only real constant is change. Simulations allow us to bring the models we build to life and get a sense of the implications of the relations over time. It has been said that we as humans have a very limited capacity to understand the implication of two or more dynamic relations over time. To help us develop our understanding in this area we simulate the models we build.

#### Simulation ####

A simulation is a dynamic model that allows us to understand the implications of relations as they unfold over time.

## A Better Way ##

Ludwig von Bertalanffy first proposed, in 1937, that the same basic structures operated across all disciplines, and if one learned how these structures operated one could transfer much of their learning from one discipline to another.{Davidson, Mark. 1983. Uncommon Sense: The Life and Thought of Ludwig von Bertalanffy. J.P. Tarcher, Inc. http://www.amazon.com/Uncommon-Sense-Thought-Bertalanffy-1901-1972/dp/087477165X/} When moving from one discipline to another, one would simply have to learn the structures that were operating, and the labels on the elements of the structures. On first reading this may seem most profound, or maybe even preposterous. However, if you think about it, maybe there is some truth to it after all.

We're not simply asking you to believe the previous statement because haven't you already demonstrated it to yourself with the first three models you created? This continued learning experience is expected to reinforce the sensibility of the statement from your own perspective.

The next model will give you a better sense of the detail associated with the unexpected unfolding of the future.

# Model

{"title": "The future we create.", "description": "There is an intent to it all.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8892"}

# End Model

Any time you set out to do anything the previous model presents a sense of what you're doing. Based on past experience the question is how do you get better at doing this to improve the chances of creating the future you're trying to create?

# Model

{"title": "The bird feeder dilemma!", "description": "All I wanted was a more pleasant morning breakfast.", "load": "http://insightmaker.com/insight/8872"}

# End Model

Hopefully this gives you a sense of difficulty one can get into when simply thinking about a single action taken to achieve a goal without consideration of the associated implications of that action. Though the limitations of this model are that it's simply a picture of relations and doesn't give you a real sense of the magnitude of anything.

The next model should provide a better sense of why dynamic models are so essential to help us develop our understanding.

- Models are simplified versions of the world around us.
- Simulations are dynamic models that help us understand changes over time.
- We build models to help us understand and learn.
- We build simple models and add to them as we learn with them.
- Building models and learning is an iterative process.
- We learn as we go and seldom do we get models right the first time.
- Linear, Reinforcing and Balancing structures are the basic building blocks for all models.
- These building blocks can aid in understanding aspects of our interactions with the world around us.
