This number of Births will then be added to the accumulation of Rabbis and figure into the calculation for the next period.","Suppose we start with 10 Rabbits, half of which are male and half of which are female. Research indicates that a female rabbit can give birth to between 18 and 26 Rabbits a year. The average for this, (18 + 24) / 2 = 22, though we'll round this up to 24 just because it will make the math easier. If a female Rabbit can produce 24 Rabbits a year, that's 2 per months, though it actually takes two Rabbits, one male and one female. With all these assumptions we get about 1 new Rabbit per month for each Rabbit.","RESULTS","Forty thousand Rabbits in a year? That seems a bit bizarre doesn't it? This result actually points out the real value of modeling, which is learning. You build a model based on what you think you understand. You then populate it with assumptions about the values and you run it. The result then either seems to make sense or seems really bizarre. When the results are really bizarre what the model is telling you is that either the structure is wrong, the assumptions are wrong, or both, because the world can't possibly be this bizarre. As a result you investigate the model and your assumptions. As your understanding improves the model gets better. At some point the model finally serves its purpose, to be a simplification of some aspect of the world which leads to a better understanding. Hopefully you come to find that going round and round with a model can be a delightful learning process.","Also, did you notice the choppy nature of the graph? This is a result of some incorrect settings and we'll talk about why this is happens and how to address it in Chapter 2.","After that sidetrack lets get back to our 40,000 Rabbits that can't possibly exist after a year. You can be pretty sure how many Rabbits you started with at the beginning. And when you check the formula for Births it seems to be in order. This sort of means the assumption for Rabbit Birth Rate must be too big. If you think about what the model is doing it's probably not too difficult to figure out that the model assumes that a Rabbit can be born this month and then give birth to another Rabbit next month. If a Rabbit has to mature for six months before it gives birth to Rabbits then the Rabbit Birth Rate might be something more like 20%.",{"attribute":"Equation","target":"Rabbit Birth Rate","value":".2"},{"attribute":"TimeStep","value":"0.25"},"RESULTS","Is this right? A good thing to remember at this point is that \"Is it right?\" is actually the wrong question. A better question might be, \"What have I learned, and is there more I can learn?\" The graph sure seems more reasonable than what the model presented in Figure 16 though do you have a high degree of confidence in the current Rabbit Birth Rate. Are there a number of other questions we could ask about our Rabbits. What is the Rabbit Death Rate? Do they have enough food to eat? Are they living out in the open where Coyotes and Foxes can get at them? Does their owner have a passion for Rabbit Stew? These might each be a basis for building a better model, though at this point we're going to leave the Rabbits alone and move on to something else."]
