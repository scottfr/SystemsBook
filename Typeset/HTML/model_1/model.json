We'll start with a very simple model containing a population of 100 people and where 2 people becoming sick each year.",{"attribute": "InitialValue", "target": "Healthy", "value": "100"},{"attribute": "FlowRate", "target": "Infection", "value": "2"},"RESULTS","The results are as we would expect. However this is not a model of an infectious disease as the infection rate does not depend on the presence of infected individuals. Let's change the infection rate so it depends on the contact rates between sick and healthy people.",{"attribute": "FlowRate", "target": "Infection", "value": "0.006*[Healthy]*[Infected]"},"RESULTS","That's strange. No one ever gets sick. Why is that? It turns out it is because we start the simulation with no infected people in the model. Since we're modeling an infectious disease, this means there is no one to start the epidemic! Let's change that we'll add a single infected person to get the epidemic started.",{"attribute": "InitialValue", "target": "Infected", "value": "1"},"RESULTS","That looks about right. Before moving on, let's spend a moment to improve our model structure. Right now if we wanted to edit the infection rate, we would have to dig down in the equations to find the right number. Let's make our model more modular, without changing any results, by separating the infection rate into its own variable.","This is what is known as the *SIR Model* (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) in the modeling community."]
