<li id="fn26"><p>This relates, more broadly, to the contrasting research approaches of induction and deduction. Induction starts with data and observations which are analyzed to create a broader theory (similar to a statistical approach to modeling). Deduction starts with a theory and finishes with the collection of data to confirm the theory (similar to a more mechanistic approach to modeling). It is easy to become mixed up with the meanings of induction and deduction and even great minds have confused them. While Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s character Sherlock Holmes attributes his impressive powers to “deduction”, he is actually using induction. Treating what we are calling “statistical” models here as a form of induction, we can also refer to them as “phenomenological” or “empirical” models.<a href="Chapter_3.html#fnref26">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>Predictions are also inferential results, but we prefer to discuss prediction and more hypothesis-testing types of inference separately. This distinction makes our understanding of modeling clearer.<a href="Chapter_3.html#fnref27">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>And we strongly recommend doing so. It is important to clearly define the purpose at the start of a project. The techniques used and data required depend significantly on the model’s overall purpose. To be very clear, it is important to clarify at the outset whether your primary goal is to use a model for prediction or for narrative. Many modeling projects may attempt to do both only to find themselves with a model that does neither.<a href="Chapter_3.html#fnref28">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>These misunderstandings are not only made by on-the-ground practitioners and analysts, they are frequently shared, and propagated, by university-level statistics instructors; see, for instance, <span class="citation">Haller and Krauss (2002)</span>.<a href="Chapter_3.html#fnref29">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>Even sports, a form of entertainment that innately contains no narrative, becomes wrapped in narrative as the announcers and commentators attempt to create stories to engage us.<a href="Chapter_3.html#fnref30">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>Other criteria include ease of use, cost of filling data requirements, and computational requirements. But all those are generally secondary to prediction accuracy.<a href="Chapter_3.html#fnref31">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>Admittedly, for complex models it may still require a significant investment on the part of an audience to fully understand the logic and equations in the model. But the opportunity is available.<a href="Chapter_3.html#fnref32">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>This is different from predictive models where the results of the model are much more important than the design and the “proof is in the pudding”&quot; so to speak.<a href="Chapter_4.html#fnref33">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>Leading to the clichéd conclusion of many modeling studies: “We are unable to draw strong conclusions from this modeling work. Instead, our contribution has been to show where additional data needs to be collected.”<a href="Chapter_4.html#fnref34">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn35"><p>When the peer review panel is hired by the client there is some conflict of interests, but the panel members should not be swayed by this.<a href="Chapter_4.html#fnref35">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>Please note that this contradicts slightly what we said earlier. Clearly, a person cannot have a negative height while the normal distribution will sometimes generate negative values. So wouldn’t a log-normal distribution be better than a normal distribution? Mechanistically, it would, however statistically we can show that due to the Central Limit Theorem the normal distribution does asymptotically precisely model our uncertainty. Given a large enough sample size (100 is more than enough in this case), the standard deviations for uncertainty will be so small that the chances of seeing a negative number (or even one far from the mean) are effectively none.<a href="Chapter_4.html#fnref36">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn37"><p>From the Greek word “epistēmē” meaning “knowledge” or “understanding”, epistemology is the branch of philosophy describing how we understand or come to know the world around us.<a href="Chapter_4.html#fnref37">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn38"><p>The model of course must also inspire confidence in its audience. They must believe its results are reliable otherwise the results will have no persuasive power. Review the previous chapter for tools for building confidence in models.<a href="Chapter_5.html#fnref38">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>Lots of “cookie cutter” models out there are designed to model a certain class of problems. Without custom work, however, these models are of dubious validity and may serve more to “check a box” that a model has been built rather than to be a useful decision-making tool.<a href="Chapter_5.html#fnref39">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn40"><p>This is a common theme in agile approaches to project management. You never want to be far from a working product. For instance, in the popular Scrum approach to managing software projects, the key unit of collective work is “the sprint”. A sprint is a relatively brief amount of time (in the scope of the entire project) to complete a set group of product features. At the end of the sprint, the features must be completed and the software working or they are cut. The goal is always to be close to a working program just like you should always be close to a working model.<a href="Chapter_5.html#fnref40">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn41"><p>This idea is adapted from Eric Ries’s excellent book <em>The Lean Startup</em> (<span class="citation">Ries (2011)</span>). In it he advocates an approach to developing start-up companies and businesses focus on rapid development and innovation. Ries supports developing a “Minimal Viable Product” for the company as quickly as possible and iterating on the feedback received for this initial product.<a href="Chapter_5.html#fnref41">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn42"><p>But the key is to wait until you get this feedback. It’s easy on your own or with a group of people to make a list of dozens mechanisms that a model <em>must</em> contain to be realistic. Once you have implemented those mechanisms in your model you might find out that no one actually cared about them. It is best to start small and then augment the model when there is a demand for some additional mechanism, than it is to spend a large amount of time implementing a very complex model and then to find out much of that work was unnecessary.<a href="Chapter_5.html#fnref42">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn43"><p>The idea of the “butterfly effect” is that the flapping of a butterfly’s wings in Europe, can initiate slight air disturbances that interact and magnify until they create a hurricane in Florida. If we believe in such avalanche effects to small events, the number of potential items we should include in the model is literally endless.<a href="Chapter_5.html#fnref43">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn44"><p>This book provides an excellent overview of a number of different models and, very interestingly, it tracks the ultimate reception and the success or failure of these models.<a href="Chapter_5.html#fnref44">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn48"><p>It is important to note at this point that when we discuss accuracies in this context we are specifically referring to models composed of continuous differential equations. If you are using agent based modeling or have discontinuities in your models – which could occur if you use If-Then-Else logic – then a smaller step size may not provide additional accuracy when there is some fundamental time step logic to the model.<a href="Chapter_6.html#fnref48">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn50"><p>Just a helpful reminder if you are starting to get lost in some of this differential equation jargon. A “state variable” is just a stock. Return to the table at the beginning of this chapter to see how these terms relate to the system dynamics modeling terminology we have already learned.<a href="Chapter_7.html#fnref50">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn51"><p>The one exception to this rule is if your curve is some sort of fractal. In this case no matter how much you zoom in on it, it will never become straight. In practice, however, this caveat is a non-issue.<a href="Chapter_7.html#fnref51">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn52"><p>And, rightly or wrongly, analytical work is generally considered more prestigious and “serious” than numerical work.<a href="Chapter_7.html#fnref52">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn53"><p>Though this metric is not often used in systems dynamics or agent-based models, it is widely used for statistical models such as linear regressions.<a href="Chapter_8.html#fnref53">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn54"><p>The key reason for this is that regular linear regression (ordinary least squares, the most widely used modeling tool) uses squared error as its measure of goodness of fit. Doing so simplifies the mathematics of the regression problem greatly in the linear case.<a href="Chapter_8.html#fnref54">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn55"><p>Likelihood is a technical statistical term. It can be roughly thought of as equivalent to “probability”, though it is not precisely that.<a href="Chapter_8.html#fnref55">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn56"><p>Weighting is a useful technique you can use for other optimization tasks. Imagine you had a model simulating the growth of your business in the next 20 years. You want to use this model to adjust your strategy to achieve three objectives: maximizing revenue, maximizing profit, and maximizing company size. Potentially maximizing profit would be the most important objective with maximizing company size being the least important. You can use weights to combine these three criteria into a single criterion for use by the optimizer.<a href="Chapter_8.html#fnref56">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn57"><p>This is true for the type of optimization problems you will generally be dealing with. Other types of optimization problems are much easier than the ones you may be encountering, as they are what are known as <em>convex</em> optimization problems and are guaranteed not to have any local minimums.<a href="Chapter_8.html#fnref57">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn58"><p>In practice an optimizer should ideally perform a bit better than this, but this provides us a useful guideline to understand optimizations. Also it should be noted that the optimizations we are talking about here are for non-linear optimization problems for which gradients (derivatives) cannot be directly calculated. For other types of optimization problems, such as linear problems, much faster optimization techniques are available.<a href="Chapter_8.html#fnref58">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn59"><p>Size could affect hamster survival and fecundity so it could be an important variable to model.<a href="Chapter_8.html#fnref59">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn60"><p>Technically the determination is that life-cycle models are the “best available science”. These decisions are misguided and frankly wrong, but that is what occurs when judges are put in the position of making highly technical scientific decisions.<a href="Chapter_8.html#fnref60">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn61"><p>The reverse – building models that are too simple – is called “underfitting”. In practice, underfitting will be less of a problem as our natural tendency is to overfit.<a href="Chapter_8.html#fnref61">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn62"><p>Statisticians would call this the “null” model, the simplest model possible.<a href="Chapter_8.html#fnref62">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn65"><p>System Dynamics also has another standard tool for dealing with heterogeneity. This tool is called “vectors”, “arrays”, “subscripting”, or “indexing” and allows you to transparently create multiple copies of your model during simulation to match different classes. Arrays are not as flexible as fully Agent Based Models though. If you consider the continuum of fully aggregate System Dynamics models on one end to fully individualized Agent Based Models on the other, we can think of arrays as existing part way along this continuum.<a href="Chapter_9.html#fnref65">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn70"><p>Please note that when you write CSS and JavaScript, your text is case-sensitive. This means that “ABC”, “abc”, and “Abc” will all be understood differently.

<li id="fn72"><p>Webpages are always stored as plain text. This differs from, for instance a Microsoft Word document (“.doc” or “.docx” extension) or a Rich Text Format document (.rtf extension). You need to ensure you save your document as a plain text document with the extension “.html” or “.htm”. You can use any text editor you want, but if you get an editor designed for writing webpages it will have helpful features such as coloring your tags differently from the standard text as you edit the webpage. We recommend Sublime Text (<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">http://www.sublimetext.com/</a>) as a high quality editor for serious work.<a href="Chapter_10.html#fnref72">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn73"><p>The name “JavaScript” is a source of perpetual confusion. What we know colloquially as JavaScript is officially called ECMAScript.
