# Beyond Connecting the Dots #

The beta v3 of Beyond Connecting the Dots interactive is now available. As you access this version please remember that it's still a "beta"! There's an overview video at...

The electronic copy of the book is available at the URL below and is password protected. Please read the following notes before accessing the online version of the book. Note the online version will be updated every couple weeks also.

## Interactive User Interface ##

* Tap or click the page to switch pages (tap on the right to move forward, tap on the left to move back) 
* Click the book title to open the table of contents 
* Click the Chapter/Section title to open up a slider to flip through the book 
* Click the aA button to change the font size 
* Tap on links or models to jump between the book sections or run a model 
* When looking at exercise answers, click the number of the exercise to jump back to the original exercise in the book 
* To access a model click the title of the model NOT the center. Clicking the center will result in a page forward or page back depending on where you click. 
* If you want to work with a model or restart a script you first have to close the graph display by clicking the Red-X Stop sign in the upper right corner to close the graph. Note that for some models there is more than one graph. 

## Beta Issues ##

* This is running on a server. This makes moving between chapters sometimes slow. When running as an app on a reader, this content will be pre-downloaded to the tablet and navigation will be faster. 
* Sometimes the page rendering gets misaligned. 
* It has only been tested on Chrome and Firefox. 
* Cover-page and art to be added 
* Book content is still under development and being edited 
* Some of the model/graph displays are out of sequence so the graph gets displayed before the model. Just click the Red-X Stop sign in the upper right corner to close the graph. 

## Beta v4 13.09.16 Access ##

Note that Scott has indicated he can't create a new betaX. URL for each revised Beta. This means that when the new one is posted it will be at the same URL as the old one. Please check the first page to ensure it has the above date. If it doesn't then tell your browser to reload it.

## Ancient History ##

Each new Beta version of the app overwrites the older one so the history is not available.

- Beta v4 available 13.09.16
- Beta v3 available 13.08.30

The .pdf copies of the content were discontinued when the content migrated to the Interactive Learning Environment format. Here are the last two that were generated. They take a while to open as they're 19-20 Mb.

- [.pdf 2103.08.06](http://www.systemswiki.org/bctd/Book.pdf)
- [.pdf 2013.07.24](http://www.systemswiki.org/bctd/Book-2013-07-24.pdf)

Creation of the individual chapters was also discontinued when the first composite Beta was created. Here are links to the previous posted versions of the individual chapters. Note the chapter numbers changed quite a few times to don't pay much attention to them. I've ordered the chapters in the same order they are in the interactive Beta version. Feedback threads for the individual chapters still reside with the [STW Sponsor's Subgroup](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=4894041)
