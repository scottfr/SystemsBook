Interactive BCTD User Interface 

* Tap or click the page to switch pages (tap on the right to move forward, tap on the left to move back) 
* Click the book title to open the table of contents 
* Click the Chapter/Section title to open up a slider to flip through the book 
* Click the aA button to change the font size 
* Tap on links or models to jump between the book sections or run a model 
* When looking at exercise answers, click the number of the exercise to jump back to the original exercise in the book 
* To access a model click the title of the model NOT the center. Clicking the center will result in a page forward or page back depending on where you click. 
* If you want to work with a model or restart a script you first have to close the graph display by clicking the Red-X Stop sign in the upper right corner to close the graph. Note that for some models there is more than one graph. 

Beta Issues 

* This is running on a server. This makes moving between chapters sometimes slow. When running as an app on a reader, this content will be pre-downloaded to the tablet and navigation will be faster. 
* Sometimes the page rendering gets misaligned. 
* It has only been tested on Chrome and Firefox. 
* Cover-page and art to be added 
* Book content is still under development and being edited 
* Some of the model/graph displays are out of sequence so the graph gets displayed before the model. Just click the Red-X Stop sign in the upper right corner to close the graph.
