<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This book, if one should really call it a book, has been most difficult to write, and this may have been somewhat evident from the Preface. While this book contains numerous models and simulations it's not about modeling or simulation. And, while the particular software used to present models and simulations is Insight Maker the book is not about Insight Maker either. What this book is about is you, your hopes and dreams, and aspirations for the future. This book is about how to develop a way of investigating the world around you to provide a better understanding. A better understanding which allows you to interact with the world around you in a manner which will give you more control over your life, a far greater possibility for attaining and achieving the things you pursue, and avoid being the victim of the world around you. With a better understanding you can address situations and create enduring solutions which don't make matters worse or create new problems in the process. The short of it is that this book is intended to provide you with a basis for avoiding a whack-a-mole future where every solution creates new problems you have to deal with.</p>
<p>What makes seeing things anew difficult is that the one has to learn how to use the glasses they look through to see things anew. The glasses are modeling which is given life making models dynamic using Insight Maker. Our task has been therefore to present a basis for a new level of understanding, its value to you and your future, without falling into the trap of creating something that looks like it's just about modeling, simulation and Insight Maker. You can let us know how well we've done.</p>
<p>In addition to the content presented here this book comes with access to a network of thousands of individuals who understand, believe and act in concert with the concepts presented here. This network of individuals is prepared and willing to support you in this journey.^[Systems Thinking World Discussion Group <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Systems-Thinking-World-2639211">http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Systems-Thinking-World-2639211</a>]</p>
<h2>Blue Jay Way</h2>
<p>As you sit at the table having breakfast you notice a blue jay outside on the railing and you think about how pleasant it is watching the blue jay as you eat breakfast. The thought comes to mind that there have been birds from time to time in the past though not very often and might a bird feeder outside attract more birds you could watch during breakfast. You toy with this thought for a while and by the time you finish breakfast you decide you definitely want to put a bird feeder outside the window.</p>
<p>You know you could just go to the store and buy a bird feeder though you're pretty handy and have wood and tools in the shed to maybe you could just build a bird feeder. So after breakfast you go look for bird feeders on the internet and find one you like that seems as though it should be rather easy to build. Now you have an image of what you want to create in your mind so you go to the shed and get the wood and tools you need and proceed to build a bird feeder. In the process you find some things are not going quite as you expect to you take some pieces apart, adjust, and move forward. After a short time you've managed to create the bird feeder you had in mind. You go to the store and purchase some bird food, install the bird feeder, and as it turns out birds really flock to it so your mornings will be pleasant watching the birds as you have breakfast.</p>
<p>Then in the morning as you're eating breakfast two squirrels run down the porch railing and leap from the railing to the bird feeder scaring the birds away and beginning to consume all the bird food. This was definitely not what you had in mind. You put the bird feeder on a poll so the squirrels could climb up though hadn't thought about them leaping from the porch so now it's time to go move the bird feeder further from the porch than the squirrels can jump. And you notice that the crows have started showing up chasing the other birds away and they're not pleasant at all to watch.</p>
<p>As the weeks pass you also notice a few other things. When it rains the bird feeder becomes a complete mess and has to be cleaned and new feed placed in it. Much of the bird seed that has fallen from the feeder is attracting other animals to feed at the base of the bird feeder. It seems that quite a bit of the feed falling on the ground has started to grow and will have to be treated or weed whacked periodically as it's becoming most unsightly. And your finding the ongoing cost of bird seed to be far more than you're really willing to spend on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>All you wanted was a peaceful breakfast watching the birds though this is not turning out anywhere near what you expected so maybe it's time to reevaluate the situation.</p>
<p>So why are we telling you this story?</p>
<p>The bird feeder is what you want to create, though it's the pleasant breakfast watching the birds you want to enable. You have a mental picture of what you want to create. You can learn about building a bird feeder from the internet though you can only learn to build a bird feeder by building a bird feeder. And to do so you need material, tools, and a lot of thought. And not only do you need tools, you need to know how to use the tools.</p>
<p>Your future is what you envision and create. You envision it with your mind though all that was envisioned was the bird feeder and the blue jays it would attract. While you may have sketched a model of the bird feeder, all the other relationships were not identified and modeled and then turn up as unintended consequences to be dealt with.</p>
<p>There are limits to the detail you can mentally accommodate. Building conceptual models of all the relevant relationships helps you develop a better understanding of the situation and avoid unintended consequences. And for may situations you have to do simulations to understand the dynamic implications of those relationships. Insight Maker is simply a tool that helps you understand the complexity associated with the future you envision and improve your chances of creating it. And the insight to take away is that it is essential to get beyond one dimensional cause and effect thinking and consider the implications of all the relevant interactions is you are to avoid a myriad of unintended consequences.</p>
