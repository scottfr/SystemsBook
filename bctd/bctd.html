<p>An interactive book intended to enable one to develop a useful understanding of the world around them and their interaction with it. The vehicle for developing that understanding is modeling and simulation, hence the &quot;Mastering the hidden connections in everything that matters.&quot; The following represents the current set of thoughts on the structure and content of the book.</p>
<p>This page now serves as the working Table of Contents and is used to surface content for <strong>Sponsor</strong> review along with the links to the various discussions where comments are to be shared. I finally realized that maintaining two files made little or no sense. Bookmarking this URL might be a good idea.</p>
<p>Content that you access for review with many instances of Insight Maker models is likely to take a while to load. Please be patient.</p>
<p>During the 13.05.22 Editor/Publisher meeting we concluded that each chapter we should be about the equivalent of 10 printed pages. I think we meant book pages rather than 8.5 x 11 printed pages. As such some of the existing content will have to be segmented.</p>

<h2>Cover</h2>
<p>Simple and direct though it needs to depict connections or relationships. Some sort of network representation. I like the cover we used on Kickstarter though Scott said we probably can't get rights to use the image. James Cameron is working on an similar alternative that won't infringe on copyrights.</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Fabian says to add a What for before Why...</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Why write this book. People need a more effective approach to learning and understanding the world around them.</li>
<li>Who is the target audience. Everyone, though the intent is for the first few chapters to be understandable and usable by a 7th grade student. By the middle of the book it will be informative for someone that has been involved in systems disciplines for years. The fourth section will be quite technical, as will the appendices.</li>
<li>How is it arranged. We will continually present examples from everyday life and then distill an understanding of those examples by building models. And through this activity the reader will develop an awareness of the utility and value of learning trough modeling. Specifically a solid introduction to an approach for improved understanding and decision making. This way we will repeatedly demonstrate how to improve our thinking to create understanding as a basis for better decision making.</li>
<li>A collection of relevant context examples will be employed from as broad a base as possible. This is expected to include models from, but not limited to, Biology, Business, Economics, Ecology, Environment, Governance, Health, Information Science, Math, Operations Management, Physics, Politics, Public Policy, Security, Sociology, Strategy, Zoology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acknowledgment</h2>

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>At this point I would ask that you not get too hung up on the titles of the various sections and chapters. As the meaningfulness of the content develops I expect that more appropriate titles for the chapters are likely to become evident.</p>
<p>This file is Table of Contents v4 13.05.30 Put comments in -&gt; <a href="http://linkd.in/11BVevI">Table of Contents</a></p>
<p>I've realized that I messed up creating a new discussion thread for each version of the chapters. It seems it would be far easier for someone following an existing thread to know about a new version of a chapter if the note and link gets posted to the thread they're currently following. We'll see how this works.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Notes to Reviewers for Chapter 1 - 4</h3>
<h4>Figure Captions</h4>
<p>Each figure is followed by a sequenced figure caption line that starts with **. These captions are also an internet links. These links are inserted so I can easily get back to wherever the figure originated should I need to create a revised version of it. These captions will be deleted by the post processor and replaced with figure captions which are embedded in the final format.</p>
<h4>Insight Maker References</h4>
<p>I'm doing the best I can representing the version of Insight Maker I won't be able to see for a couple of months. The interactive Insight Maker models are embedded from Insight Maker and the model is owned my me. This means that when one looks at it in this chapter it doesn't look like it will look in the final book. Scott is creating a version of Insight Maker that will operate in a touch tablet environment. That version of Insight Maker will be embedded in the book and each book owner will own the models in the book. That means they will look somewhat different. I have to code something so I'll know what to include later and so that reviewers can look the models and connect with the written words associated with it. Getting through this seems to be a tall order.</p>
<h4>Macros</h4>
<p>There are certain aspects of the text formatting we don't quite have figured out yet. We have resigned ourselves to the fact that we won't have this figured out for some time. As such macros are being coded to be replaced in the content post processing phase. I sorry that it's likely to make the text a bit more difficult to read.</p>

<h1>Act I - Learning About Learning</h1>
<h2><a name="c1"></a>Chapter 1 - It's The Pattern That Connects</h2>
<p>How we learn about ourselves and the world around us by building models. And we build lots of different kinds of models to help us understand. Provide examples of the models we build. Include thoughts on the way we reinforce our models, protect and evolve them. Explain the limitations of our models and how they are often flawed and the implications of operating with flawed models.</p>
<ul>
<li>Patterns</li>
<li>Models</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Flawed Learning</li>
<li>A Better Way</li>
<li>Pictures of Models</li>
<li>Dynamic Models</li>

<li>Filling a Swimming Pool</li>
<li>Similar Structure Different Behavior</li>
<li>Summary</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that it make take some time for the page to load because of the embedded Insight Maker models.</p>
<p>v3 is considered to be a solid edit in response to the comments on v1 &amp; v2 of the chapter. There are no significant changes from v2.</p>

</ul>
<h2><a name="c2"></a>Chapter 2 - Dynamic Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Part of the perceived difficulty associated with writing this book is that I have to assume no understanding of modeling and no understanding of Insight Maker. As such an awareness of each must be developed in an as needed to deal with the content approach. This chapter is mostly about developing a familiarity with the Insight Maker environment though it also covers the basis for the construction of Stock &amp; Flow Models.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Blank Canvas</li>
<li>Stocks, Flows, Variables and Links</li>
<li>Valid Primitive Connections</li>
<li>Configuration Panel</li>
<li>Common Property # 1</li>
<li>Constructing a Reinforcing/Growth Structure</li>
<li>Common Property  # 2</li>
<li>Constructing a Balancing/Goal Seeking Structure</li>
<li>Summary</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that it make take some time for the page to load because of the embedded Insight Maker models.</p>
<p>v2 actually represents a name change as the content is actually more about the modeling and simulation environment than model building, which will be covered in Chapter 4. Also note that the link for Chapter 2v2 comments is the same thread that was used for v1.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./environment-v2/environment.html">v2 13.05.31</a> Put comments in -&gt; <a href="http://linkd.in/14QjOLs">Chapter 2 Comments</a></li>
<li><a href="./modeling-v1/modeling.html">v1 13.04.24</a> Put comments in -&gt; <a href="http://linkd.in/14QjOLs">Chapter 2 Comments</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="c3"></a>Chapter 3 - A Model Is A Model Is A Model</h2>
<p>This is a new addition as we think it's appropriate to develop an awareness that there are other types of models as well as an awareness that the model one uses depends on what they're trying to understand and the nature of the questions they ask.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rich Pictures</li>
<li>Causal Loop Diagrams</li>
<li>Unfolding a Model</li>
<li>Summary</li>
<li>References</li>
</ul>
<p>Updated the the text and diagrams to agree with the relabeling that was done in Insight Maker to change Unfolding to Storytelling.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./models-v2/models.html">v2 13.06.19</a> Put comments in -&gt; <a href="http://linkd.in/11jWl1g">Chapter 3 Comments</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Is this really v1? The chapter that was Chapter 3 is now Chapter 4 so this is the first version of this incarnation of this content for Chapter 3. As such I decided to call if v1.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./models-v1/models.html">v1 13.06.02</a> Put comments in -&gt; <a href="http://linkd.in/11jWl1g">Chapter 3 Comments</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="c4"></a>Chapter 4 - Building a Model</h2>
<p>Now that the most relevant aspects of Insight Maker have been introduced it is appropriate to provide the reader with a meaningful process to use when they set out to build a model.</p>
<p>Three models here will be done first as qualitative models and quantitative models.</p>
<ul>
<li>Model Construction Process</li>
<li>Modeling Guidelines</li>
<li>Can Red Get to Grandma's?</li>
<li>Why Aren't We All Rich?</li>
<li>Where Have All The Trees Gone? (to be added maybe)</li>
<li>Summary</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 4v3 does some clean up and adds a new model at the end &quot;What happened to all the trees?&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./building-v3/building.html">v3 13.06.21</a> Put comments in -&gt; <a href="http://linkd.in/11fR6wu">Chatper 4 Comments</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 4 was chapter 3 until the new Chapter 3 was written. As such Chapter 4v1 will still internally indicate that it's Chapter 3v1. Don't worry, it confuses me also. Also I wanted to add another model to this chapter thought it's already way too long. Not sure how this will resolve.</p>

<h1>Act II - The Evolution of Structure</h1>
<h2><a name="c5"></a>Chapter 5 - Implications of Reality</h2>
<p>This chapter is actually a series of mini chapters collectively with two intents, 1) to show the typical evolution of the simple balancing and reinforcing structure; 2) to demonstrate how the same model can be applicable across apparently unrelated areas of study. This will be accomplished though the development of patterns of behavior which occur in every area of study imaginable and then showing how that pattern can be represented by a relatively simple combination of reinforcing and goal seeing structures that you learned about in Chapter 2.</p>
<p>Each model is presented as a causal loop diagram and a stock &amp; flow simulation model the reader can interact with. Additionally for each model effective strategies for dealing with the models is provides along with area of concern based on likely evolution of the model. A link to additional examples is also provided.</p>
<p>Three Basic Structures
Typical Evolving Relationships
Fix A Problem
- Linear Progress Slows Over Time
- The Fix Overshoots The Goal
- Things Seem To Oscillate Endlessly
- The Fix Creates A Problem Elsewhere
- Over Time There Is A Tendency to Settle For Less
- In Time The Problem Returns
- The Underlying Cause Is Not Being Addressed
- Dependence On The Fix Develops
Trying To Promote Growth
- Growth Leads To Decline Elsewhere
- Growth Slows Over Time
- Partners For Growth Become Adversaries
- Limited Resources Are Shared By Others
- More Than One Limit To Be Addressed
- The Limit Is Insufficient Capacity
- There IS A Tendency To Let The Standard Slip
Summary</p>
<p>Note that Chapter 5 may take 1 to 5 minutes to load depending on the speed of your internet connection.</p>
<p>v0.8 finished the first pass on the reinforcing structures though I still need to write additional descriptions, with additional simulation runs, and figure out some meaningful exercises.</p>

<li><a href="./reality-v08/reality.html">v0.8 13.06.25</a> Put comments in <a href="http://linkd.in/13xqSZv">Chapter 5 Comments</a></li>
</ul>
<p>v0.6 finishes the balancing loop structures though there's still a differentiation between the Shifting the Burden and the Addiction structure that has to be sorted out as well as identification of which examples to include for each structure.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./reality-v06/reality.html">v0.6 13.06.17</a> Put comments in <a href="http://linkd.in/13xqSZv">Chapter 5 Comments</a></li>
</ul>
<p>v0.0 was put up on June 10th because I committed to getting it there by then. As I worked on it I realized it was me that should have been committed. I think the chapter is only about 25% complete and we're going to have to figure out what to do with it because it's way too large. Please review what's there and let me know what you think.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Act III - Applying the Learning</h1>
<h2><a name="c6"></a>Chapter 6 - Applied Understanding</h2>
<p>Now that we've worked though a large number of cross discipline models providing examples of how to ferret out understanding though the development of models lets talk about applying this approach to some real life situations.</p>
<p>I expect this section will actually be a single chapter with multiple sections, each one dedicated to elaborating a different model provided by the publisher sponsors of this effort. I'm pretty sure this will ensure the models will be from very different disciplines. </p>
<p>The idea is to share the thought processes associated with developing an understanding for a new situation from scratch.</p>
