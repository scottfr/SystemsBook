# Foreword #

Throughout the development of this book I thought about how important it was, how it represented such great potential value to all of us. And, how is it different from books on the same subject that have gone before it.

Why is this an important book for our time? It is important because of the understanding it can help us develop - understanding why the world we have created has become apparently so complicated, and what to do about it. Over time we have woven the fabric of our existence ever tighter, and with ever more rapid interactions. And, when we do not understand the complexity we have created, we feel helpless, and become victims of what we do not understand.

Why is it that as we approach our goals they seem to be more difficult to achieve? Why is it that things progressing so well seem sooner or later to turn sour? And when things turn sour, how is it that they seem to do so in such a rapid fashion? Why is it that every problem we solve seems simply to lead to a whole new set of problems? Why is it that the problems we thought we solved yesterday seem to come back to haunt us in a few weeks or months? Why is it that a group of individuals each doing what seems so sensible manages to create something that none of them want, i.e. bureaucracy? Why it is that no matter how much money I make it never seems to be enough? Why is it that co-operative partnerships that should produce tremendous results so often end with the partners becoming adversaries? 

The list of questions is rather endless, and our normal pursuit from a cause and effect perspective is to try to find where the fault lies. A systems perspective, however, enables us to understand the foundations of such situations. A systems perspective enables one to progress beyond simply seeing events, to seeing patterns of interaction and the underlying structures which are responsible for the patterns. And, once we understand the real foundations for the situations we experience, we are in a much better position to respond in an enlightened fashion. We are able to act responsibly and interact with the structures in ways which will enhance or improve the situation without making the situation worse or creating new problems elsewhere.

Beyond Connecting the Dots enables us to develop a better understanding of the world around us, why this understanding is so important to us in our daily lives, and how we can all can benefit from the understanding. Once we embrace the complexity we have created, and find the simplicity on the other side, we no longer need to be victims, for we can use our understanding to change our actions and thereby our world. 

You have probably heard of the Butterfly Effect, where it was proposed that a butterfly flapping its wings in Miami could cause a hail storm in Beijing. Our actions today have more immediate far reaching consequences, which was simply not the case in the past. And the pace of our interactions continues to increase. Systems Thinking is a perspective more important for our time than any other we have ever had the opportunity to embrace.
