Foreword

Throughout the development of this book I thought about how important it was, how it represented such great potential value to all of us. And, when I was asked to write the foreword, I was quite humbled.

Why is this an important book for our time? It is important because of the understanding it can help us develop - understanding why the world we have created has become apparently so complicated, and what to do about it. Over time we have woven the fabric of our existence ever tighter, and with ever more rapid interactions. And, when we do not understand the complexity we have created, we feel helpless, and become victims of what we do not understand.

Why is it that as we approach our goals they seem to be more difficult to achieve? Why is it that things progressing so well seem sooner or later to turn sour? And when things turn sour, how is it that they seem to do so in such a rapid fashion? Why is it that every problem we solve seems simply to lead to a whole new set of problems? Why is it that the problems we thought we solved yesterday seem to come back to haunt us in a few weeks or months? Why is it that a group of individuals each doing what seems so sensible manages to create something that none of them want, i.e. bureaucracy? Why it is that no matter how much money I make it never seems to be enough? Why is it that co-operative partnerships that should produce tremendous results so often end with the partners becoming adversaries? 

The list of questions is rather endless, and our normal pursuit from a cause and effect perspective is to try to find where the fault lies. A Systems Thinking perspective, however, enables us to understand the foundations of such situations. Systems Thinking enables one to progress beyond simply seeing events, to seeing patterns of interaction and the underlying structures which are responsible for the patterns. And, once we understand the real foundations for the situations we experience, we are in a much better position to respond in an enlightened fashion. We are able to act responsibly and interact with the structures in ways which will enhance or improve the situation without creating new and different problems elsewhere. 

Systems thinking is a perspective we can all relate to, as examples of it can be repeatedly found in our daily lives. Peter Senge’s “The Fifth Discipline,” (Doubleday 1994) has contributed greatly toward popularizing it, yet his context is that of Organizational Learning, wherein Systems Thinking was the fifth of five disciplines. My own thought as I read Senge’s book, five times in five years, was that it should have been called “The First Discipline” as the other four disciplines are essentially applied systems thinking. 

The Art of Systems Thinking enables us to develop an understanding of systems thinking, why it is so important to us in our daily lives, and how one and all can benefit form the understanding. Once we embrace the complexity we have created, and find the simplicity on the other side, we no longer need to be victims, for we can use our understanding to change our actions and thereby our world. 

You have probably heard of the Butterfly Effect, where it was proposed that a butterfly flapping its wings in Miami could cause a hail storm in Beijing. Our actions today have more immediate far reaching consequences, which was simply not the case in the past. And the pace of our interactions continues to increase. Systems Thinking is a perspective more important for our time than any other we have ever had the opportunity to embrace. 

I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the authors for investing the thought and effort required to provide this opportunity for understanding to the world.
