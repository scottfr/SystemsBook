## The Fix Overshoots the Goal ##

Have you ever pursued a goal and later found that you actually overshot the goal and had to back up to get back to the goal? The Balancing Loop with Delay structure is a variation of the standard Balancing Loop. The variation being that there are one or more delays in the structure which are responsible for producing, as will be demonstrated, a very different behavior pattern than the standard Balancing Loop.

### Causal Loop Diagram ###

![](05-im-544.png)

[Balancing Loop with Delay Causal Loop Diagram](http://insightmaker.com/insight/544)

If you look at the Balancing Loop with Delay structure it looks identical to the standard balancing loop with the exception of the delay near the reduces link. The implication is that it takes some amount of time after the current state changes before it is actually realized and figures into the calculation of the gap which influences the subsequent action. Essentially what's happening is that action is being based on old data and therefore is probably not the appropriate action. The implications of this will become evident when we look at the simulation for this structure.

### Stock & Flow Simulation ###

[Balancing Loop with Delay Stock & Flow Simulation](http://insightmaker.com/insight/133)

Notice in the stock & flow structure the delay has been placed between the current state and the gap. The delay could have just as well been between the gap and action or there could have been a delay between the action and the actual change of the current state though this one is a bit more difficult to structure.

Equations for this structure are

> delay state = Delay(<Current State>, [time delay], 0)
> gap = [desired state] - [delay state]
> action = [gap] * [action factor]

With settings of

- current state = 0
- action factor = 0.5
- desired state = 1
- time delay = 0
- Time Step = 0.25

![](05-im-133a.png)

[Balancing Loop with Delay = 0](http://insightmaker.com/insight/133)

As expected these settings display the typical balancing loop goal seeking behavior.

With settings of

- current state = 0
- action factor = 0.5
- desired state = 1
- time delay = 1
- Time Step = 0.25

![](05-im-133b.png)

[Balancing Loop with Delay = 1](http://insightmaker.com/insight/133)

Notice that now with a delay the change in the gap and action are delayed for one time period and then the current state actually overshoots the goal and a negative action is required to bring the current state back to the goal.

With settings of

- current state = 0
- action factor = 0.5
- desired state = 1
- time delay = 2
- Time Step = 0.25

![](05-im-133c.png)

[Balancing Loop with Delay = 2](http://insightmaker.com/insight/133)

With a longer time delay the overshoot is even more severe though after a few time periods the current state actually will reach the goal.

----------

### Modeling Note ###

Notice the action flow in the diagram actually has an arrow at both ends. Click on the flow and notice the Configuration section of the configuration panel indicates Only Positive Rates is set to No. This means that the flow can flow in either direction based on whether the results of the equation are positive or negative.

----------

With settings of

- current state = 0
- action factor = 0.5
- desired state = 1
- time delay = 3
- Time Step = 0.25

![](05-im-133d.png)

[Balancing Loop with Delay = 3](http://insightmaker.com/insight/133)

We've now reached a delay where the action is so out of sync with an awareness of the results that the goal is never reached and the current state continually oscillates around the goal.

With settings of

- current state = 0
- action factor = 0.5
- desired state = 1
- time delay = 3.5
- Time Step = 0.25

![](05-im-133e.png)

[Balancing Loop with Delay = 3.5](http://insightmaker.com/insight/133)

Now the situation is described as being out of control because rather oscillations continue to get worse because of the length of the time delay.

You might ask how could it be that it might take 3.5 days for someone to get a sense of what the results of the previous actions were, which would be a good question. It's probably difficult to find a situation where this is realistic in days though what's important to realize is this structure could operate in this manner if the time units were hours, minutes, seconds or micro seconds.

----------

### Exercise 5-3 

Run this model varying the values of action factor, time delay and time step to develop a sense of how each of these variables influences the behavior of the model.

----------

### Examples ###

[Balancind Loop with Delay Examples](http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Balancing_Loop_with_Delay)

### Effective Strategies ###

- Advice for dealing with this structure is quite simple. Patience is a virtue. If you know you're dealing with a balancing structure and things are not going as expected then study the structure to see if there could be one or more delays that your impatience is simply having difficulty dealing with. This structure proves that there are times when taking additional action is worse than not taking additional action. More is not always better. If things are waffling back and forth endlessly or out of control a little less effort might be appropriate.
- An alternative is to monitor the Current State on a more frequent basis and ensure the result of the monitoring impacts the action appropriately in a more timely manner. In short, take the delay out of the structure.

### Areas of Concern ###

There are currently no known Systems Archetypes which are direct derivatives of the Balancing Loop with Delay Systems Archetype.

## Things Seem to Oscillate Endlessly ##

Have you ever noticed how some things just seem to oscillate back and forth endlessly? Trying to decide between two options, the way people have their ups and downs, the way supply and demand never seems to settle out are examples of just this.

This situation is characteristic of two Balancing Loops with Delays which provide the desired state for each other. Because of the delays in the structure by the time one value reaches the point it's headed for, its destination has moved, so it begins changing again. This is very much like shooting at a target bobbing up and down on the end of a spring while you're jumping up and down on a trampoline.

### Causal Loop Diagram ###

[Indecision Causal Loop Diagram](http://insightmaker.com/insight/545)

### Stock & Flow Simulation ###

[Indecision Stock & Flow Simulation](http://insightmaker.com/insight/546)

With settings of

- result 1 = 1
- result 2 = 0.5
- delay 2 = 1
- delay 1 = 2
- factor = 0.5
- Time Step = 0.25

![](05-im-546.png)

[Indecision Example 1](http://insightmaker.com/insight/546)

For these settings there is a delay for result 1 and result 2 and you can see the oscillations as action attempts to bring the two into a balance with each other. It is apparent that a balance will be achieved after some time as the oscillations are getting smaller over time.

----------

### Exercise 5-4 

Vary the values of delay 1, delay 2, factor, and time step to get a better sense of the implications of each variable on the behavior of this structure. 

----------

### Examples

- [Romeo & Juliet IM-759](http://insightmaker.com/insight/759)
- [Indecision Examples](http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Indecision)

### Effective Strategies ###

- Because of the inherent delays in this structure it is completely inappropriate to base action on what the current driving value is. To deal with this structure one has to watch the cycles and attempt to predict what the driving value is going to be at a future point. One then creates a result 1 that will be appropriate for the predicted future result 2. In this structure a well operating crystal ball would be most helpful.
- Reducing the action in the short term until on gets a sense of the influences is most advisable.

### Areas of Concern ###

- Presently there are no Systems Archetypes which are derivatives of the Indecision Systems Archetype.

## The Fix Creates A Problem Elsewhere ##

Have you ever wondered how the apparently sensible actions by two individuals, groups, or countries for that matter, can result in both parties finding themselves where neither of them wants to be? Consider the way an argument heats up between two people, or the way that urgency begets urgency, or even the US/Soviet arms race of the past. The foundation of these activities is an Escalation structure.

### Causal Loop Diagram ###

![](05-im-970.png)

[Escalation Causal Loop Diagram](http://insightmaker.com/insight/970)

The two balancing loops interact in such a way as to create what is essentially a single reinforcing structure. Is this this reinforcing action which typically drives the result to somewhere neither of the participants wishes to be.

[Escalation Example](http://insightmaker.com/insight/972)

----------

### Exercise 5-5 

Vary the values of Ted Results, Anne Results and time step to get a better sense of the implications of each variable on the behavior of this structure. 

----------

### Examples ###

- A kid telling a small lie to cover a small thing, only to find himself into further problems that would require bigger lies, making it all the more difficult to tell the truth later when two people walking against each other on the street try to pass by making a step sideways only to discover they block each other again and another attempt to go off the way leads to the same situation
- [Escalation Examples](http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Escalation)

### Effective Strategies ###

- One approach is to disconnect the two loops so Anne and Tom are no longer competing with each other but competing with themselves. This produces two reinforcing loops.
- The second approach is to begin evaluating the composite results of Anne and Tom rather than their individual results. In this way they begin to see the value in cooperation rather than competition and the structure turns into two synergistic reinforcing loops.

### Areas of Concern ###

- There are currently no known Systems Archetypes which are derivatives of the Escalation Systems Archetype.

## Over Time There Is A Tendency To Settle For Less

Have you ever noticed how difficult it is to bring the best of intentions to fruition? How so many people's New Years resolutions only last a few days? Our inability to achieve the things we set out to achieve is very much a result of the operation of a Drifting Goals structure we generally have little awareness of.

### Causal Loop Diagram ###

![](05-im-983.png)

[Drifting Goals Causal Loop Diagram](http://insightmaker.com/insight/983)

Again we have two balancing loops which each provide a goal for the other and because of the delays in the time it takes for the action to produce results one goal overrides the other. What I Want server as the goal for B1 and Pressure to Settle for Less serves as the goal for B2.

### Stock & Flow Simulation ###

[Drifting Goals Stock & Flow Simulation](http://insightmaker.com/insight/984)

With settings of

- desired state = 1
- curretn state = 0
- pct chg fact = 0.2
- goal chg fact = 0.2
- Time Step = 0.5

![](05-im-948.png)

[Drifting Goals Example with pct chg = goal chg factors](http://insightmaker.com/insight/972)

In this example with the extent to which the goal drifted is about 50% which is very significant. The extent to which the goal drifts is very dependent on the goal chg fact variable.

----------

### Exercise 5-6 

Vary the pct chg fact, goal chg fact and Time Step values to get a sense of the impact on the extent to which the goal for the structure is degraded over time.

----------

### Examples ###

- [Drifting Goals Examples](http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Drifting_Goals)

### Effective Strategies ###

- There is only one real effective way to deal with this structure, which is to disconnect the feedback from tension to goal reduction to Desired State so it can no longer subtract from Desired State.
- An alternative strategy is to further increase the action toward the Current State so it reduces the time delay such that there is no time for the tension to reduce the Desired State. This is fine if there are sufficient resources to increase the action.

### Areas of Concern ###

- The action toward the Desired State requires resources, which may have to be developed. Consideration needs to be given as to whether or not there really are sufficient resources to achieve the Desired State. For further insights into this see Growth and Underinvestment with a Drifting Standard.

## In Time The Problem Returns ##

Have you noticed how often your best intentions go awry? You set out to fix a problem and shortly thereafter you find yourself fixing the same problem again, and again. This generally results from some unexpected consequences, things that come into play because of your action, or the results of your action, that you never expected, which is why they're called unexpected consequences.

A Fixes that Fail Systems Archetype consists of a Balancing Loop which is intended to achieve a particular result, yet the result is foiled by an insidious Reinforcing Loop. These two loops interact in such a way that the desired result initially produced by the Balancing Loop is, after some delay, negated by the actions of the Reinforcing Loop. This structure may also be referred to as a Remedies that Fail structure.

### Causal Loop Diagram ###

![](05-im-547.png)

[Fixes that Fail Causal Loop Diagram](http://insightmaker.com/insight/547)

The action of the Goal Seeking loop (B1) also influences, after some delay, unexpected consequences which diminishes the migration of the current sate in the direction of the desired state and creates the reinfocing loop (R2).

### Stock & Flow Simulation ###

[Fixes that Fail Stock & Flow Simulation](http://insightmaker.com/insight/549)

With settings of

- desired state = 1
- current state = 0
- action factor = 0.5
- uc factor = 0
- ucd factor = 0.2
- Time Step = 0.5

![](05-im-549.png)

[Fixes that Fail Structure as Simple Goal Seeking Loop](http://insightmaker.com/insight/549)

With uc factor = 0 there is no unexpected consequences and therefor the value of ucd factor is irrelevant and the structure is essentially a standard goal seeking balancing loop (B1).

With settings of

- desired state = 1
- current state = 0
- action factor = 0.5
- uc factor = 0.3
- ucd factor = 0.2
- Time Step = 0.5

![](05-im-549a.png)

[Fixes that Fail Structure as Simple Goal Seeking Loop](http://insightmaker.com/insight/549)

As the value of uc factor increases unexpected consequences will increase more rapidly and have a more marked impact on the current state as long as the value of ucd factor remains constant.

----------

### Exercise 5-7 

Run the Fixes that Fail structure with various values of action factor, uc factor, ucd factor, and Time Step to get a sense of how these four factors influence the behavior of the structure.

----------

### Examples ###

- Your soccer ball is soft so you put air in it though in a few hours you have to put more air in it. And after a few weeks it seems like you spend all your time pumping up your soccer ball.
- Often times what appears to be the most appropriate way to deal with the situation doesn't really solve the problem and in time actually makes the situation worse.
- [Fixes that Fail Examples](http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Fixes_that_Fail)

### Effective Strategies ###

- The most effective strategy for dealing with this structure is advance planning. Since you can never do just one thing, as everything affects everything else, before taking action to change the current state, think about what else that action, or change in the current state, is likely to affect. And, what effect the effect will have. Sometimes the unexpected consequence may be several effects away, so don't stop at just one. Essentially what one seeks to do is close the loop and identify the unexpected, which means it's no longer unexpected then, is it?
- A less effective strategy would be to figure out how to disconnect the unexpected consequence from influencing the action or the current state. Of course then it wouldn't be a consequence, would it?

### Areas of Concern ###

- There are times when attempts to deal with a situation in a particular way makes it even more difficult to deal with the situation in an appropriate manner later on which is often an indication of a Shifting the Burden Systems Archetype.

## The Underlying Cause Is Not Being Addressed ##

How many times have you noticed that there are some problems that seem to be addressed over and over. When the problem arises it is addressed, then some time later, maybe a day, a week, or a month, the same problem arises again. This situation is quite often the result of a Shifting the Burden structure.

### Causal Loop Diagram ###

![](05-im-986.png)

[Shifting the Burden Causal Loop Diagram](http://insightmaker.com/insight/986)

The causal loop depicts a problem symptom which can be addressed by a symptomatic solution (B1) and a fundamental solution (B2). The symptomatic solution is easier and quicker than the fundamental solution though it only treats the symptoms rather than actually solving the problem. And the nasty aspect of this structure is that the symptomatic solution typically has a side effect that makes it more difficult to implement the fundamental solution. This means that the more one employs the symptomatic solution the less likely one is to implement the fundamental solution. And because the problem isn't solved in time it returns again and again.

### Stock & Flow Simulation ###

[Shifting the Burden Stock & Flow Simulation](http://insightmaker.com/insight/1005)

The Shifting the Burden Stock & Flow model is the equivalent of the Causal Loop Diagram with one addition. Problem Cause has been added to as it is essentially for the Problem Symptom to be able to return. This wasn't depicted in the Causal Loop Diagram and points out one of the shortcomings of Causal Loop Diagrams. Because they're qualitative you can argue any interactions you'd like and they're difficult to dispute because there's no data to support any of the arguments. With Stock & Flow models one can't argue things with hand waving and there's no smoke and mirrors to hide behind. Everything has to be explicit which is their strength.

With settings of

- sym fact = 0.5
- prob fact = 0.5
- fund fact = 0
- side effect fact = 0
- Time Step = 0.25

![](05-im-1005.png)

[Applying the Symptomatic Solution](http://insightmaker.com/insight/1005)

The problem cause results in an increase in the Problem Symptom until it reaches a level where it needs to be dealt with and the symptomatic solution is applied. This removes the Problem Symptom though has no affect on the problem cause so the Problem Symptom again begins to increase until it reaches a point where the symptomatic solution is again applied. Unless something else changes this will repeat endlessly.

With settings of

- sym fact = 0.5
- prob fact = 0.5
- fund fact = 0.2
- side effect fact = 0
- Time Step = 0.25

![](05-im-1005a.png)

[Applying the Symptomatic Solution & Fundamental Action](http://insightmaker.com/insight/1005)

In this example it is apparent that the Symptomatic Solution is still has a part to play while the fundamental solution is actually solving the problem. Once this happens the symptoms don't return and there no need to apply the symptomatic solution or fundamental action in the future.

With settings of

- sym fact = 0.5
- prob fact = 0.5
- fund fact = 0.2
- side effect fact = 0.2
- Time Step = 0.25

![](05-im-1005b.png)

[Applying the Symptomatic Solution & Fundamental Action with Side Effect](http://insightmaker.com/insight/1005)

With the Side Effect coming into play you can see that the fundamental solution attempts to come into play though the side effect essentially negates it requiring that the symptomatic solution continue to be applied periodically.

----------

### Exercise 5-8 

While there are myriad of possible variations for the variables in this model you might find the result interesting if you apply the fundamental solution without the symptomatic solution. What questions does this result raise?

----------

### Examples ###

- [Summer Driving is an Emergency?](http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Summer_Driving_is_an_Emergency%3F)
- [Shifting the Burden Examples](http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Shifting_the_Burden)

### Effective Strategies ###

Initially I perceived there to be a single appropriate strategy for dealing with this structure though I have found examples, which I will attach as soon as I get them sorted out, which seem support the range of strategies below.

- Learn to live with the symptomatic solution because that's as good as it's going to get. There are situations where there may be more effective solutions though you'll just never get them implemented in your lifetime. Sad but true.
-Implement the fundamental solution because if the symptomatic solution is implemented the strength of the side effect will ensure the fundamental solution will never get any traction.
- When dealing with a problem ask yourself if you are treating the symptoms or addressing the real cause of the problem. Often, out of expediency, the symptomatic solution is essential. The most effective strategy for dealing with a Shifting the Burden structure is to employ the symptomatic solution AND develop the fundamental solution. Thus one resolves the immediate problem and the other works to ensure that it doesn't return.

### Areas of Concern ###

- It is often the case that the side effect promotes some sort of dependency which further inhibits development of the fundamental solution. For insights into this situation see Addiction Systems Archetype.

## Dependence on the Fix Develops ##

An Addiction Systems Archetype is a variation of a Shifting the Burden Systems Archetype in which the side effect results is an addiction to the symptomatic solution. This structure is composed of two Balancing Loops and a Reinforcing Loop. It is a very annoying structure because the two Balancing Loops act as a single Reinforcing Loop migrating the situation in the same direction as the Reinforcing Loop. Both structures cooperate in moving the system in a direction other than the one desired.

### Causal Loop Diagram ###

![](05-im-1085.png)

[Addiction Causal Loop Diagram](http://insightmaker.com/insight/1085)

It should be immediately evident that this is the same structure as the shifting the burden structure with the Side Effect relabeled as Addiction. The difference in function will be demonstrated below in the stock & flow model.

### Stock & Flow Simulation ###

[Addiction Stock & Flow Simulation](http://insightmaker.com/insight/1086)

I need to do is figure out how the addiction is different from shifting the burden structure. I think the side effect in shifting the burden may not be a stock whereas addiction is a stock. This was once the problem is solved in shifting the burden there isn't a residual influence from the side effect whereas in the addiction structure there is a significant residual.

----------

### Exercise 5-9 

I don't know about this at the moment.

----------

### Examples ###

- in organizations, people firefighting instead of solving the root problems, thereby reducing time available to invest in solving root problems
- I'm sure we could easily set up a similar example for short term economical measures that redirect resources from what could fix the economy in the longer term, though any model would probably be controversial.
- Wanting to win all the time can be really hard, and to increase your chances of winning, there are two options. One option is to cheat. The other option is to practise all the time and demonstrate a serious commitment to your sport. Whilst cheating is probably easier, it becomes highly addictive (because it doesn't require much effort) and because of this, the desire to win fairly though practise and commitment to your sport doesn't happen. Think of what happened to Lance Armstrong. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/102156844/Loop%20Structures/Lance%20Armstrong%20Shifting%20the%20Burden.jpeg 
- [Addiction Examples](http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Addiction)

### Effective Strategies ###

- When dealing with a problem ask yourself if you are treating the symptoms or addressing the real cause of the problem. Often, out of expediency, the symptomatic solution is essential. The most effective strategy for dealing with an Addiction structure is dealing with the Addiction AND employment of the symptomatic solution AND development of the Fundamental Solution. This approach resolves the immediate problem and works to ensure that it doesn't return. Once one becomes addicted an external support system is often necessary to break the Addiction.

### Areas of Concern ###

- There are currently no known direct derivatives of the Addiction Systems Archetype.

## Growth Leads to Decline Elsewhere ##

As long as A and B are equally successful everything will remain stable. Though if A or B receive more resources than the other or A or B is more successful than the other the imbalance will result in greater success of a or b accordingly and promote even more success of the one that demonstrates greater success.

### Exercise 5-11 

Run the model with different values of factor and pulse to get a sense of the impact they have on the results. What conclusions does this interaction lead you to?

- balancing two boats http://bit.ly/17CI6sH
- [Success to the Successful Examples](http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Success_to_the_Successful)

### Effective Strategies ###

There are actually two strategies for dealing with a Success to the Successful situation.
- Identify the resource being unequally distributed and balance the distribution.
- Disconnect the two reinforcing structures so they are not dependent on the allocation of resources based on their results. While the allocation based on results may initially appear to make sense it might actually be the reason for the results.

### Areas of Concern ###

- There are currently no known Systems Archetypes which are derivatives of the Success to the Successful Systems Archetype.

## Partners for Growth Become Adversaries ##

The Accidental Adversaries Systems Archetype represents a structure where two entities which would be in a synergistic growth relationship end up limiting each others results because of their own activities.

### Causal Loop Diagram ###

![](05-im-177.png)

[Accidental Adversaries Causal Loop Diagram](http://insightmaker.com/insight/177)

A Activity contributes to B Success and B Activity contributes to A Success and we have a reinforcing structure R1. The problem arises when either A or B does something that promotes their own success which also acts to inhibit the success of the other. The other responds with an attempt to compensate for whatever is inhibiting their success though their action tends to inhibit the success of the other. As such the two entities that should be cooperating for their mutual success become adversaries.

### Stock & Flow Simulation ###

[Accidental Adversaries Stock & Flow Simulation](http://insightmaker.com/insight/178)

With settings of

- B Success = 0.5
- A Success = 0.5
- B to B Ctrl = 0
- A to A Ctrl = 0
- Simulation Length = 10
- Time Step = 1

![](05-im-178.png)

[Standard Reinforcing Behavior](http://insightmaker.com/insight/178)

When A and B are cooperating they are producing equivalent results.

With settings of

- B Success = 0.5
- A Success = 0.5
- B to B Ctrl = 0
- A to A Ctrl = 0.5
- Simulation Length = 10
- Time Step = 1

![](05-im-178a.png)

[Standard Reinforcing Behavior](http://insightmaker.com/insight/178)

With A acting to promote it own success its actions diminish B Success and B will then expend energy attempting to compensate for the action by A. And then A will act to compensate for the actions by B which tend to inhibit the success of B. Thus we have a vicious cycle where the two were far better off cooperating.

----------

### Exercise 5-13 

Why is it that the results balance whenever B to B Ctrl = A to A Ctrl?

----------

### Examples ###

- Parents can be interesting. Both Mums and Dads want to act as good role models and create a positive family environment, but sometimes, each one of them gets caught up in being seen as ''the good parent" and gives in to our whims and desires. We all know how this works: If one parent says 'no' to something, we just ask the other parent. The problem is that when one or both of our parents wants to be seen as the ''good parent,'' the other one ends up being seen as the 'bad' or 'tough' parent, and the whole 'good role model' or 'good family environment' disintegrates pretty quickly.

### Effective Strategies ###

This structure points out how myopic local activity, with the best of intentions, can lead to an overall limiting development of the global system, and actually inhibit local development as well.
- A and B need to determine whether it is really better to be partners in creating the future or competitors, and do one or the other, not both. At present A and B are neither as they undermine each others success to promote their own success. Sounds like enemies to me.
- Alternatively, some higher authority could alter the structure in such a way that A to A and B to B didn't promote the individual result of A and B.
- Another alternative would be to alter the structure in such a way that the result is not measured in terms of A and B individually but in terms of the total result of the two of them together. In this way it should be quite quickly evident that each is undermining their own success through their self-serving actions.

### Areas of Concern ###

- There are currently no known Systems Archetypes that are derivatives of the Accidental Adversaries Systems Archetype.

## Limited Resources are Shared by Others ##

A Tragedy of the Commons situation exists whenever two or more activities, each, which in order to produce results, rely on a shared limited resource. Results for these activities continue to develop as long as their use of the limited resource doesn't exceed the resource limit. Once this limit is reached the results produced by each activity are limited to the level at which the resource is replenished. As an example, consider multiple departments with an organization using IT resources, until they've exhausted IT capacity.

Notice that both A and B demonstrate exponential behavior until they diminish resources to the replenishment rate. At that time they them begin to demonstrate linear growth as they are limited by the replenishment rate. B result begins greater than A result and grows even faster than A because it consumes more resources.

----------

### Exercise 5-14 

- What happens if either A or B decides at some point to reduce their consumption of resources?

### Effective Strategies ###

This structure repeatedly appears in organizational contexts where a service organization supports the success of multiple departments who fail to support the service organization in return. There are two strategies for dealing with this structure, one more effective than the other.
- The most effective strategy for dealing with this structure is to wire in feedback paths from A's result and B's result to the resource replenishment so as A and B use resources their results promotes the availability of additional resources.
- The alternate, and less effective, strategy for dealing with this structure is to add an additional resource to control the use of resources by A and B. This strategy limits the overall potential results of the structure to the predefined resource limit. It also adds additional resources to the equation, and probably results in endless disputes as to the fairness associated with the allocation of resources. While not really the most appropriate strategy this is the one most often used --- out of ignorance I would suspect.
- More ecological approach would be for A and B to realize what they're doing and collaboratively manage their activity and the resource such that it isn't depleted. Yes, it could happen.

### Areas of Concern ###

There are currently no known Systems Archetypes which are derivatives of Tragedy of the Commons.

## More Than One Limit To Be Addressed ##

It's relatively well understood that you can't be all things to all people. Somewhere one has to make choices. An Attractiveness Principle Systems Archetype is essentially a Limits to Growth Systems Archetype with multiple limits, all of which can not be addressed equally.

[Attractiveness Principle Stock & Flow Simulation](http://insightmaker.com/insight/1117)

With settings of

- limiting factor 2 = 6
- limiting factor 1 = 4
- Results = 0.5
- action factor = 0.9
- slowing fact = 0.8
- Simulation Length = 10
- Time Step = 0.25

![](05-im-1117.png)

[Tragedy of the Commons Example](http://insightmaker.com/insight/1117)

With a sufficient growth rate Results grow fast enough such that limiting factor 1 can't sufficiently constrain the growth so limiting factor 2 also kicks in. With lower level growth rates it might be the case that only one constraint would become effective. And if the limiting factors came into effect at the same level then they would both have an impact. There are numerous variations for the interactions within this structure.

----------

### Exercise 5-15 

- Reduce the action factor to a point where growth doesn't overwhelm the limiting factors to see the affect on the result.

----------

### Examples ###

- [Attractiveness Principle Examples](http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Attractiveness_Principle)
- 
### Effective Strategies ###

- A strong offense is the most effective defense. Being aware that there is a growth situation in effect should induce the insightful to look for limiting factors because they will come into play sooner or later. Once limiting factors are identified steps should be taken to inhibit the limiting factors before they inhibit results.
- It is generally the case that limiting factors do not come into play at the same levels of results. As such, one needs to be concerned with the timing of the limiting factors. It makes little sense to inhibit factors before they are about to act as limiting factors.
- It is often the case that all the limiting factors cannot be addressed. When this is the case one must decide which ones to inhibit and which ones to live with. If possible the factor promoting the greatest limitations should be eliminated first as it will provide the greatest gain.

### Areas of Concern ###

There are currently no known direct derivatives of the Attractiveness Principle Systems Archetype.

## The Limit Is Insufficient Capacity ##

A Growth and Underinvestment Systems Archetype is simply an elaborated Limits to Growth Systems Archetype where the growth inhibitor is part of another Balancing Loop with an external standard and some delay. The real nasty thing about this structure is that the two Balancing Loops form a single Reinforcing Loop which inhibits growth.

### Exercise 5-16 

- Can you adjust the parameters such that result growth is not inhibited?

----------

### Examples ###

- [Growth and Underinvestment Examples](http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Category:Growth_and_Underinvestment)

### Effective Strategies ###

- The only effective strategy for dealing with this structure is foresight. One has to study the implications of the Result before the Result actually places demands on the system and develop the slowing action avoidance before it is actually needed. Have you ever noticed that runners seem to be the people that least need to run? It's because they run.

### Areas of Concern ###

- It is possible that under pressure the standard may drift and this structure will develop into a Growth and Underinvestment with a Drifting Standard Systems Archetype.

## There Is A Tendency To Let The Standard Slip ##

A Growth and Underinvestment with a Drifting Standard structure is simply an elaborated Growth and Underinvestment structure where the growth inhibitor induces a decline of the standard over time. The real nasty thing about this structure is that the growth inhibitor influence sets up a Reinforcing Loop which even further promotes a drifting of the standard over time.

With settings of

- Result = 0.5
- Inhibitor Avoidance = 0.5
- base standard = 1
- action factor = 0.5
- need factor = 1
- inhibitor factor = 0.5

- Time Step = 0.5

[Tragedy of the Commons Example](http://insightmaker.com/insight/1126)

Because it takes time for the Inhibitor Avoidance to develop the standard slips from the base standard. As such the Inhibitor Avoidance doesn't develop to the extent that it should and the growth inhibitor is inhibited thus limiting the Result.

----------

### Exercise 5-17 

- How do you adjust the parameters so the standard doesn't slip?

### Effective Strategies ###

- The only effective strategy for dealing with this structure is foresight. One has to study the implications of Result before Result actually places demands on the system and develop the Inhibitor Avoidance before it is actually needed. Have you ever noticed that runners seem to be the people that least need to run? It's because they run.
- And, in this structure it is essential to ensure that the standard is not diminished by the tension created by the growth inhibitor.

### Areas of Concern ###

- There are currently no known Systems Archetypes which are based on the Growth and Underinvestment with a Drifting Standard Systems Archetype.

## Summary ##

The chapter should explicitly depict the relationships between the structures presented in the previous sections and explain the natural evolution paths for the structures.
