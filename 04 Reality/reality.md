# Chapter 3 Implications of Reality v1 13.05.xx #

----------

Notes to Reviewers

This chapter is actually a series of mini chapters collectively with one intent. That being to demonstrate how the same model can be applicable across apparently unrelated areas of study. This will be accomplished though the development of patterns of behavior which occur in every area of study imaginable and then showing how that pattern can be represented by a relatively simple combination of reinforcing and goal seeing structures that you learning about in Chapter 2.

The following chapters actually represent the most common systems archetypes though we're not going to surface that fact until later. And we're definitely not going to use the term Systems Archetypes. The intent is to simply, via examples, extend the two basic structures and produce models for each of these extension.

What we expect will happen is that the reader will develop an understanding of the value of critically thinking about the possible implications of the current structure and the various ways in which it may evolve into more complex structures.

For each chapter there are real world examples which are then developed into structure. The reader is asked to interact with the models provided and then asked to identify similar structures from their experience, clone the existing structure and update the model to reflect their example. And once the model is created it should be simulated.

## Three Basic Structures ##

In the previous chapter we covered the three basic structures of Figure 1 in some detail. And it was claimed that all the models you will ever create will simply be a combination of some number of these basic structures. We don't expect that you take this on faith and while we can't prove it in this chapter we will provide you an opportunity to experience some of the more common structures which occur repeatedly across all disciplines of science.

## Growth Slows Over Time ##

Figure 2 presents a structure composed of a growth structure, R1, with a balancing structure added on the right. The only difference in the balancing structure is that it is set up in such a way that it doesn't have an effect on the results until the results reach a certain level.

- Rabbits tend to multiply very rapidly so why is it we're not completely overrun by rabbits, well maybe everywhere except Australia?
- - keep playing instead of cleaning up the mess in the room, which makes further play difficult, AND the increased mess repels the kid from cleaning up.


## Limited Resources Are Shared By Others ##

## Growth Leads To Decline Elsewhere ##

## Partners For Growth Become Adversaries ##

- Parents can be interesting. Both Mums and Dads want to act as good role models and create a positive family environment, but sometimes, each one of them gets caught up in being seen as ''the good parent" and gives in to our whims and desires. We all know how this works: If one parent says 'no' to something, we just ask the other parent. The problem is that when one or both of our parents wants to be seen as the ''good parent,'' the other one ends up being seen as the 'bad' or 'tough' parent, and the whole 'good role model' or 'good family environment' disintegrates pretty quickly.

## In Time The Problem Returns ##

- Your soccer ball is soft so you put air in it though in a few hours you have to put more air in it. And after a few weeks it seems like you spend all your time pumping up your soccer ball.

Often times what appears to be the most appropriate way to deal with the situation doesn't really solve the problem and in time actually makes the situation worse.

## The Fix Creates A Problem Elsewhere ##

-- a kid telling a small lie to cover a small thing, only to find himself into further problems that would require bigger lies, making it all the more difficult to tell the truth later
 when two people walking against each other on the street try to pass by making a step sideways only to discover they block each other again and another attempt to go off the way leads to the same situation

## The Fix Overshoots the Goal ##

## Dependence On The Fix Develops ##

- in organizations, people firefighting instead of solving the root problems, thereby reducing time available to invest in solving root problems
- I'm sure we could easily set up a similar example for short term economical measures that redirect resources from what could fix the economy in the longer term, though any model would probably be controversial.
- - Wanting to win all the time can be really hard, and to increase your chances of winning, there are two options. One option is to cheat. The other option is to practise all the time and demonstrate a serious commitment to your sport. Whilst cheating is probably easier, it becomes highly addictive (because it doesn't require much effort) and because of this, the desire to win fairly though practise and commitment to your sport doesn't happen. Think of what happened to Lance Armstrong. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/102156844/Loop%20Structures/Lance%20Armstrong%20Shifting%20the%20Burden.jpeg 

## Everything is Connected ##

The chapter should explicitly depict the relationships between the structures presented in the previous sections and explain the natural evolution paths for the structures.
