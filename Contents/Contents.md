# Beyond Connecting the Dots: Mastering the hidden connections in everything that matters - Table of Contents v3 - 13.05.23 #

An interactive book intended to enable one to develop a useful understanding of the world around them and their interaction with it. The vehicle for developing that understanding is modeling and simulation, hence the "Mastering the hidden connections in everything that matters." The following represents the current set of thoughts on the structure and content of the book.

This page now serves as the working Table of Contents and is used to surface content for **Sponsor** review along with the links to the various discussions where comments are to be shared. I finally realized that maintaining two files made little or no sense. Bookmarking this URL might be a good idea.

Subscribing to the [Project Notes from Gene & Scott](http://linkd.in/16kqXAy) thread in the [Sponsors Subgroup](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=4894041) is strongly encouraged as this will be the best place to get updates as to changes and updates.

Content that you access for review with many instances of Insight Maker models is likely to take a while to load. Please be patient.

During the 13.05.22 Editor/Publisher meeting we concluded that each chapter we should be about the equivalent of 10 printed pages. I think we meant book pages rather than 8.5 x 11 printed pages. As such some of the existing content will have to be segmented.

## Cover ##

Simple and direct though it needs to depict connections or relationships. Some sort of network representation. I like the cover we used on Kickstarter though Scott said we probably can't get rights to use the image. James Cameron is working on an similar alternative that won't infringe on copyrights.

## Preface ##

* Why write this book. People need a more effective approach to learning and understanding the world around them.
* Who is the target audience. Everyone, though the intent is for the first few chapters to be understandable and usable by a 7th grade student. By the middle of the book it will be informative for someone that has been involved in systems disciplines for years. The fourth section will be quite technical, as will the appendices.
* How is it arranged. We will continually present examples from everyday life and then distill an understanding of those examples by building models. And through this activity the reader will develop an awareness of the utility and value of learning trough modeling. Specifically a solid introduction to an approach for improved understanding and decision making. This way we will repeatedly demonstrate how to improve our thinking to create understanding as a basis for better decision making.
* A collection of relevant context examples will be employed from as broad a base as possible. This is expected to include models from, but not limited to, Biology, Business, Economics, Ecology, Environment, Governance, Health, Information Science, Math, Operations Management, Physics, Politics, Public Policy, Security, Sociology, Strategy, Zoology.

## Table of Contents ##

At this point I would ask that you not get too hung up on the titles of the various sections and chapters. As the meaningfulness of the content develops I expect that more appropriate titles for the chapters are likely to become evident.

This file is Table of Contents v3 13.05.23 Put comments in -> [Table of Contents](http://linkd.in/16ksmHv)

I've realized that I messed up creating a new discussion thread for each version of the chapters. It seems it would be far easier for someone following an existing thread to know about a new version of a chapter if the note and link gets posted to the thread they're currently following. We'll see how this works.

----------

### Notes to Reviewers for Chapter 1 - 4 ###

#### Figure Captions ####

Each figure is followed by a sequenced figure caption line that starts with **. These captions are also an internet links. These links are inserted so I can easily get back to wherever the figure originated should I need to create a revised version of it. These captions will be deleted by the post processor and replaced with figure captions which are embedded in the final format.

#### Insight Maker References ####

I'm doing the best I can representing the version of Insight Maker I won't be able to see for a couple of months. The interactive Insight Maker models are embedded from Insight Maker and the model is owned my me. This means that when one looks at it in this chapter it doesn't look like it will look in the final book. Scott is creating a version of Insight Maker that will operate in a touch tablet environment. That version of Insight Maker will be embedded in the book and each book owner will own the models in the book. That means they will look somewhat different. I have to code something so I'll know what to include later and so that reviewers can look the models and connect with the written words associated with it. Getting through this seems to be a tall order.

#### Macros ####

There are certain aspects of the text formatting we don't quite have figured out yet. We have resigned ourselves to the fact that we won't have this figured out for some time. As such macros are being coded to be replaced in the content post processing phase. I sorry that it's likely to make the text a bit more difficult to read.

# Act I - Learning About Learning #

## Chapter 1 - It's the pattern that connects ##

How we learn about ourselves and the world around us by building models. And we build lots of different kinds of models to help us understand. Provide examples of the models we build. Include thoughts on the way we reinforce our models, protect and evolve them. Explain the limitations of our models and how they are often flawed and the implications of operating with flawed models.

- Patterns
- Models
- Learning
- Flawed Learning
- A Better Way
- Pictures of Models
- Dynamic Models
- Rabbit Population Growth
- Filling a Swimming Pool
- Similar Structure Different Behavior
- Summary

Note that it make take some time for the page to load because of the embedded Insight Maker models.

## Chapter 2 - Dynamic Building Blocks ##

Part of the perceived difficulty associated with writing this book is that I have to assume no understanding of modeling and no understanding of Insight Maker. As such an awareness of each must be developed in an as needed to deal with the content approach. This chapter is mostly about developing a familiarity with the Insight Maker environment though it also covers the basis for the construction of Qualitative Models and Quantitative Models.

- The Blank Canvas
- Stocks, Flows, Variables and Links
- Qualitative Models
- Valid Primitive Connections for Quantitative Models
- Configuration Panel
- Common Property # 1
- Constructing a Growth Structure (this will now be done as a CLD & SFD)
- Common Property  # 2
- Constructing a Goal Seeking Structure (this will now be done as a CLD & SFD)
- Summary

## Chapter 3 - Building a Model ##

Now that the most relevant aspects of Insight Maker have been introduced it is appropriate to provide the reader with a meaningful process to use when they set out to build a model.

Three models here will be done first as qualitative models and quantitative models.

- Can Red Get to Grandma's?
- Why Aren't We All Rich?
- Where Have All The Trees Gone? (to be added)
- Summary

- [v1 13.05.18](./building-v1/building.html) Put comments in -> [Chapter 3 - Building a Model](http://linkd.in/14CL1Ny) 

## Chapter 4 - A Model Is A Model Is A Model

This is a new addition where we think it's appropriate to develop an awareness that there are lots of different kings of models and which one uses depends on what they're trying to understand and the nature of the questions they ask.

- Causal Loop Diagrams
- Connection Circles
- Systemic Grams
- Rich Pictures
- Systemigrams
- Summary

This chapter will provide a link to Scott Page's [Model Thinking Course](http://bit.ly/13LoU5d).

# Act II - The Evolution of Structure #

## Chapter 5 - Implications of Reality ##

What I want to provide here is a sense of the natural tendency for the simple balancing and reinforcing structures to evolve thus demonstrating the way the [Systems Archetypes](http://bit.ly/13Lgo6i) are related. What I'm struggling with is that I think it would take the equivalent of 60 pages for me to include all the archetypes. As such I figure I have to start with the initial two structures and so a couple evolutionary steps and then provide a link to the [Systems Archetypes](http://bit.ly/15ZvkUh) learning thread.

# Act III - Applying the Learning #

## Chapter 6 - Applied Understanding ##

Now that we've worked though a large number of cross discipline models providing examples of how to ferret out understanding though the development of models lets talk about applying this approach to some real life situations.

I expect this section will actually be a single chapter with multiple sections, each one dedicated to elaborating a different model provided by the publisher sponsors of this effort. I'm pretty sure this will ensure the models will be from very different disciplines. 

The idea is to share the thought processes associated with developing an understanding for a new situation from scratch.

The following are provided as potential models for entries in segments of this chapter.
