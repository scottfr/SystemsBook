# Beyond Connecting the Dots - Content Thoughts v2 - 13.03.25 #

An interactive book intended to enable one to develop a useful understanding of the world around them and their interaction with it. The vehicle for developing that understanding is modeling and simulation, hence the "Mastering the hidden connections in everything that matters." The following represents the current set of thoughts on the structure and content of the book.

## Cover ##

Simple and direct though it needs to depict connections or relationships. Some sort of network representation. I like the current cover though Scott said we probably can't get rights to use the image.

## Preface ##

* Why wright this book. People need a more effective approach to learning and understanding the world around them.
* Who is the target audience. Everyone, though intended to be readable, at least the first parts, by a 7th grade student. By the middle of the book it will be informative for someone that has been involved in systems disciplines for years. The fourth section will be quite technical, as will the appendices.
* How is it arranged. We will continually present examples from everyday life and then distill an understanding of those examples by building models. And through this activity the reader will develop an awareness of the utility and value of learning trough modeling. Specifically a solid introduction to an approach for improved understanding and decision making. This way we will repeatedly demonstrate how to improve our thinking to create understanding as a basis for better decision making.
* A collection of relevant context examples will be employed from as broad a base as possible. This is expected to include models from, but not limited to, Biology, Business, Economics, Ecology, Environment, Governance, Health, Information Science, Math, Operations Management, Physics, Politics, Public Policy, Security, Sociology, Strategy, Zoology.

## Table of Contents ##

At this point I would ask that you not get too hung up on the titles of the various sections and chapters. As the meaningfulness of the content develops I expect that the titles to be associated with the chapters should be relatively evident.

# Act I - Learning About Learning #

## It's the pattern that connects ##

How we learn about ourselves and the world around us by building models. And we build lots of different kinds of models to help us understand. Provide examples of the models we build. Include thoughts on the way we reinforce our models, protect and evolve them. Explain the limitations of our models and how they are often flawed and the implications of operating with flawed models.

The chapter has to include lots of models to develop this understanding though at this point I expect the models are mostly picture images of various situations.

The Bertalanffy idea that the same structures operate across all disciplines is surfaced in here somewhere.

## Building Better Thought ##

The world around us is dynamic and we function in that world dynamically though most of the models we build are static. The models are just snapshots in time of the real dynamics of the world. We try to infer the implications of things in the future from snapshots of the past and present. And for reasons that will become evident this is a very inadequate basis for interacting in a meaningful way in the world.

From the examples previously presented, and probably a few more here, distill out an awareness of the concepts associated with a accumulator, flow, variable and connector. And use these elements to construct models of some of the example situations presented.

Then revisit the inadequate nature of the elements being used to build static pictures to understand a dynamic world.

Construct some simple dynamic models with no feedback just to begin to get a sense of the nature of doing a simulation.

## So Different and So Similar ##
 
Using examples from multiple disciplines to synthesize the accumulator-flow structure. From the simple accumulator-flow structure evolve the growth loop and goal seeking loop. Use examples with the broadest possible connection.

## Dynamic Lego Blocks ##

Part of the perceived difficulty associated with writing this book is that I have to assume no understanding of modeling and no understanding of Insight Maker. As such an awareness of each much be developed in an as needed to deal with the content approach.

After the two basic structures are developed talk about the valid ways the building blocks can be connected. What represents valid structure, what doesn't and why.

Present the basics features of the modeling environment sufficient to allow the reader to build the models they have interacted with to this point. The difficulty associated with doing this at this stage is that all I have to work with is the current Insight Maker interface. And this interface is being redesigned to be touch friendly for the touch pad environment. This probably means that the first pass at this chapter will provide the capabilities that have to be presented and then the detail will have to be revised once the interface is finished.

# Act II - The Growth of Structure #

## Implications of Reality ##

The following chapters actually represent the most common systems archetypes though we're not going to surface that fact until later. And we're definitely not going to use the term Systems Archetypes. The intent is to simply, via examples, extend the two basic structures and produce models for each of these extension.

What we expect will happen is that the reader will develop an understanding of the value of critically thinking about the possible implications of the current structure and the various ways in which it may evolve into more complex structures.

For each chapter there are real world examples which are then developed into structure. The reader is asked to interact with the models provided and then asked to identify similar structures from their experience, clone the existing structure and update the model to reflect their example. And once the model is created it should be simulated.

I expect we will identify additional structures that should be included as chapters of this section.

The segments below Implications of Goal Seeking and Implications of Growth should be labeled as appropriately as possible so people connect with the nature of the interactions. As I've said previously, don't get hung up on the labels at this point. Once the content is elaborated I expect that the chapter titles will be self-evident. While all of the alternatives below are relevant I'm not sure if we can fit them all in.

## Implications of Goal Seeking ##

- Linear progress slows over time
- The fix overshoots the goal
- Things seem to oscillate endlessly
- The fix creates problems elsewhere
- In time the problem returns
- Underlying causes not being addressed
- Dependence on the fix develops
- Over time there is a tendency to settle for less
- Tendency to let the standard slip

## Implications of Growth ##

- Growth slows over time
- Growth leads to decline elsewhere
- Partners for growth become adversaries
- Limited resources are shared by others
- More than one limit to be addressed
- The limit is insufficient capacity

## Everything is Connected ##

The chapter should explicitly depict the relationships between the structures presented in the previous sections and explain the natural evolution paths for the structures.

# Act III - Applying the Learning #

## Applied Understanding ##

Now that we've worked though a large number of cross discipline models providing examples of how to ferret out understanding though the development of models lets talk about applying this approach to some real life situations.

I expect this section will actually be several chapters, each one dedicated to elaborating a different model provided by the publisher sponsors of this effort. I'm pretty sure this will ensure the models will be from very different disciplines.

The idea is to share the thought processes associated with developing an understanding for a new situation from scratch.

This will probably be in some evolved form of the **Enabling a Better Tomorrow** or **Systemic Perspective** learning threads at [SystemsWiki.org](http://www.systemswiki.org/). There are YouTube play lists for [Network Magic](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?feature=edit_ok&list=PL6_vtryFPrNUS_gy59LhIncDYbBXmkdS9) and [AR Period Reduction](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6_vtryFPrNViDGlFlMlV5rMC390icYvB), two examples developed based on the learning threads.

How many chapters will this be? That sort of depends on how long it takes the group to identify them and develop a new meaningful surfacing approach.
