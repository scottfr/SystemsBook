<h1>Beyond Connecting the Dots - Content Thoughts v3 - 13.05.22</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>where does model calibration go?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interactive book intended to enable one to develop a useful understanding of the world around them and their interaction with it. The vehicle for developing that understanding is modeling and simulation, hence the &quot;Mastering the hidden connections in everything that matters.&quot; The following represents the current set of thoughts on the structure and content of the book.</p>
<h2>Cover</h2>
<p>Simple and direct though it needs to depict connections or relationships. Some sort of network representation. I like the current cover though Scott said we probably can't get rights to use the image. James Cameron is working on this.</p>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why write this book. People need a more effective approach to learning and understanding the world around them.</li>
<li>Who is the target audience. Everyone, though intended to be readable, at least the first parts, by a 7th grade student. By the middle of the book it will be informative for someone that has been involved in systems disciplines for years. The fourth section will be quite technical, as will the appendices.</li>
<li>How is it arranged. We will continually present examples from everyday life and then distill an understanding of those examples by building models. And through this activity the reader will develop an awareness of the utility and value of learning trough modeling. Specifically a solid introduction to an approach for improved understanding and decision making. This way we will repeatedly demonstrate how to improve our thinking to create understanding as a basis for better decision making.</li>
<li>A collection of relevant context examples will be employed from as broad a base as possible. This is expected to include models from, but not limited to, Biology, Business, Economics, Ecology, Environment, Governance, Health, Information Science, Math, Operations Management, Physics, Politics, Public Policy, Security, Sociology, Strategy, Zoology.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acknowledgment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Listing all those who supported the effort through Kickstarter</li>
<li>Other supporters via different avenues</li>
</ul>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>At this point I would ask that you not get too hung up on the titles of the various sections and chapters. As the meaningfulness of the content develops I expect that the titles to be associated with the chapters should be relatively evident.</p>
<h1>Act I - Learning About Learning</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1 - It's the pattern that connects</h2>
<p>How we learn about ourselves and the world around us by building models. And we build lots of different kinds of models to help us understand. Provide examples of the models we build. Include thoughts on the way we reinforce our models, protect and evolve them. Explain the limitations of our models and how they are often flawed and the implications of operating with flawed models.</p>
<ul>
<li>Patterns</li>
<li>Models</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>A Basis for Flawed Learning</li>
<li>A Better Way</li>
<li>Rabbit Population Growth</li>
<li>Filling a Swimming Pool</li>
<li>Similar Structure Different Behavior</li>
<li>Summary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 2 - Dynamic Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Part of the perceived difficulty associated with writing this book is that I have to assume no understanding of modeling and no understanding of Insight Maker. As such an awareness of each must be developed in an as needed to deal with the content approach. This chapter is mostly about developing a familiarity with the Insight Maker environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Blank Canvas</li>
<li>Stocks, Flows, Variables and Links</li>
<li>Valid Primitive Connections</li>
<li>Configuration Panel</li>
<li>Common Property # 1</li>
<li>Constructing a Growth Structure</li>
<li>Common Property  # 2</li>
<li>Constructing a Goal Seeking Structure</li>
<li>Summary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 3 - Building a Model</h2>
<p>Now that the most relevant aspects of Insight Maker have been introduced it is appropriate to provide the reader with a meaningful process to use when they set out to build a model.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can Red Trip to Grandma's?</li>
<li>Why Aren't We All Rich?</li>
<li>Where Have All The Trees Gone? (to be added)</li>
<li>Summary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 4 - A Model Is A Model Is A Model</h2>
<p>This is a new addition where we think it's appropriate to develop an awareness that there are lots of different kings of models and which one uses depends on what they're trying to understand and the nature of the questions they ask.</p>
<ul>
<li>Causal Loop Diagrams</li>
<li>Connection Circles</li>
<li>Systemic Grams</li>
<li>Rich Pictures</li>
<li>Systemigrams</li>
<li>Summary</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter will provide a link to Scott Page's &quot;Model Thinking&quot; course.</p>
<h1>Act II - The Growth of Structure</h1>
<h2>Chapter 5 - Implications of Reality</h2>
<p>The following chapters actually represent the most common systems archetypes though we're not going to surface that fact until later. And we're definitely not going to use the term Systems Archetypes. The intent is to simply, via examples, extend the two basic structures and produce models for each of these extension.</p>
<p>What we expect will happen is that the reader will develop an understanding of the value of critically thinking about the possible implications of the current structure and the various ways in which it may evolve into more complex structures.</p>
<p>For each chapter there are real world examples which are then developed into structure. The reader is asked to interact with the models provided and then asked to identify similar structures from their experience, clone the existing structure and update the model to reflect their example. And once the model is created it should be simulated.</p>
<p>I expect we will identify additional structures that should be included as chapters of this section.</p>
<p>The segments below Implications of Goal Seeking and Implications of Growth should be labeled as appropriately as possible so people connect with the nature of the interactions. As I've said previously, don't get hung up on the labels at this point. Once the content is elaborated I expect that the chapter titles will be self-evident. While all of the alternatives below are relevant I'm not sure if we can fit them all in.</p>
<h2>Implications of Goal Seeking</h2>
<ul>
<li>Linear progress slows over time</li>
<li>The fix overshoots the goal</li>
<li>Things seem to oscillate endlessly</li>
<li>The fix creates problems elsewhere</li>
<li>In time the problem returns</li>
<li>Underlying causes not being addressed</li>
<li>Dependence on the fix develops</li>
<li>Over time there is a tendency to settle for less</li>
<li>Tendency to let the standard slip</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implications of Growth</h2>
<ul>
<li>Growth slows over time</li>
<li>Growth leads to decline elsewhere</li>
<li>Partners for growth become adversaries</li>
<li>Limited resources are shared by others</li>
<li>More than one limit to be addressed</li>
<li>The limit is insufficient capacity</li>
</ul>
<h2>Everything is Connected</h2>
<p>The chapter should explicitly depict the relationships between the structures presented in the previous sections and explain the natural evolution paths for the structures.</p>
<h1>Act III - Applying the Learning</h1>
<h2>Chapter 6 - Applied Understanding</h2>
<p>Now that we've worked though a large number of cross discipline models providing examples of how to ferret out understanding though the development of models lets talk about applying this approach to some real life situations.</p>
<p>I expect this section will actually be a single chapter with multiple sections, each one dedicated to elaborating a different model provided by the publisher sponsors of this effort. I'm pretty sure this will ensure the models will be from very different disciplines. (Or should this be one chapter per Sponsor model, which would mean there are 16 chapters here).</p>
<p>The idea is to share the thought processes associated with developing an understanding for a new situation from scratch.</p>
<p>This will probably be in some evolved form of the <strong>Enabling a Better Tomorrow</strong> or <strong>Systemic Perspective</strong> learning threads at <a href="http://www.systemswiki.org/">SystemsWiki.org</a>. There are YouTube play lists for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?feature=edit_ok&amp;list=PL6_vtryFPrNUS_gy59LhIncDYbBXmkdS9">Network Magic</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6_vtryFPrNViDGlFlMlV5rMC390icYvB">AR Period Reduction</a>, two examples developed based on the learning threads.</p>
<p>How many chapters will this be? That sort of depends on how long it takes the group to identify them and develop a new meaningful surfacing approach.</p>
<h1>Act IV - Supporting Principles</h1>
<h2>Chapter 7 - The Mathematics of Modeling</h2>
<ul>
<li>How a simulation programs works
