Before starting the tutorial, make sure you have familiarized yourself with how to <a href='http://insightmaker.com/diagramming' target='_blank'>create primitives</a> and <a href='http://insightmaker.com/simulating' target='_blank'>run models</a>."},

{"create":"Stock","geometry":{"x":400,"y":280,"width":100,"height":40},"name":"Infected"},

{"target":"Infected","geometry":{"x":400,"y":280,"width":100,"height":40}},

"DIAGRAM",

{"create":"Flow","geometry":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":100,"height":100},"alpha":"Healthy","omega":"Infected","name":"Infection"},

"DIAGRAM",

"The basic model structure has been laid-out, we can start to define parameter values and equations. We'll start with a very simple model containing a population of 100 people and where 2 people becoming sick each year.",

{"attribute":"InitialValue","target":"Healthy","value":"100"},

{"attribute":"FlowRate","target":"Infection","value":"2"},

"RESULTS",

"The results are as we would expect. However this is not a model of an infectious disease as the infection rate does not depend on the presence of infected individuals. Let's change the infection rate so it depends on the contact rates between sick and healthy people.",

{"attribute":"FlowRate","target":"Infection","value":"0.006*[Healthy]*[Infected]"},

"RESULTS",

"That's strange. No one ever gets sick. Why is that? It turns out it is because we start the simulation with no infected people in the model. Since we're modeling an infectious disease, this means there is no one to start the epidemic! Let's change thatl we'll add a single infected person to get the epidemic started.",

{"attribute":"InitialValue","target":"Infected","value":"1"},

"RESULTS",

"That looks about right. Before moving on, let's spend a moment to improve our model structure. Right now if we wanted to edit the infection rate, we would have to dig down in the equations to find the right number. Let's make our model more modular, without changing any results, by separating the infection rate into its own variable.",

{"create":"Variable","geometry":{"x":230,"y":145,"width":120,"height":50},"name":"Infection Rate"},

{"create":"Link","geometry":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":100,"height":100},"alpha":"Infection Rate","omega":"Infection"},

"DIAGRAM",

{"attribute":"Equation","target":"Infection Rate","value":"0.006"},

{"attribute":"FlowRate","target":"Infection","value":"[Infection Rate]*[Healthy]*[Infected]"},

"RESULTS",

"We can hide the display of the infection rate by configuring the display.",

{"attribute":"Primitives","target":"DISPLAY","value":["Healthy", "Infected"]},

"RESULTS",

"Now that we have our basic model working, let's extend it by adding the phenomena of people recovering from the disease. We'll model something like the Chicken Pox where people become immune to the disease after they recover.",

{"create":"Stock","geometry":{"x":400,"y":400,"width":100,"height":40},"name":"Immune"},

{"target":"Immune","geometry":{"x":400,"y":400,"width":100,"height":40}},

{"create":"Flow","geometry":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":100,"height":100},"alpha":"Infected","omega":"Immune","name":"Recovery"},

{"create":"Variable","geometry":{"x":610,"y":290,"width":120,"height":50},"name":"Recovery Rate"},

{"create":"Link","geometry":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":100,"height":100},"alpha":"Recovery Rate","omega":"Recovery"},

"DIAGRAM",

{"attribute":"Equation","target":"Recovery Rate","value":"0.1"},

{"attribute":"FlowRate","target":"Recovery","value":"[Recovery Rate]*[Infected]"},

{"attribute":"Equation","target":"Infection Rate","value":"0.008"},

{"attribute":"Primitives","target":"DISPLAY","value":["Healthy", "Infected", "Immune"]},

"RESULTS",

"Fantastic! Now we have a working disease simulation. You can experiment with different population sizes, infection rates and recovery rates to see how they change the results.\n\nThis is what is known as the *SIR Model* (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) in the modeling community."
