# A Model Is A Model Is A Model

In previous chapter you interacted with two types of models qualitative models, i.e., no numbers, Follow the Clues and Bird Feeder Dilemma and quantitative models, with numbers, all the simulation models you ran. In this chapter we'll present two types of qualitative models, Rich Pictures and Causal Loop Diagrams, and more detail about quantitative Stock & Flow Simulation Models.

## Storytelling ##

Even though you may conscientiously develop your model and add comments often it turns out that people initially look at the whole model and are immediately overwhelmed. It might be somewhat like trying to eat a whole Elephant in a single bite. Storytelling provides a way to overcome this difficulty.

Storytelling a model is intended to reveal a model little by little and explain it along the way. Click on the View Story button in the lower left corner of the screen, read the text, and then click the Step Forward arrow on the right repeatedly to have the model presented as a story.

Because the Storytelling function isn't included in this environment references are presented to acquaint you with how to create stories in Insight Maker.

## Summary ##

Always remember that a model is a simplification of the world around you intended to help you understand something. You should use a modeling form that adequately serves your quest for understanding. Stock & Flow, Rich Picture, and Causal Loop models are only three of a very large array of possible modeling forms that exist. Use them to the extent that they serve you and when they don't find a form that does. The Modeling and Simulation references provide access to several additional types of diagrams that have been created with Insight Maker, though there are probably more that haven't yet been identified. The Model Thinking Course by Scott E. Page presents a very extensive exposure to many types of models useful for understanding different aspects of the world around us.

### Rich Pictures ###

- Often easier for others to relate to and understand because of the images in the model.
- No rules for creating them though remember that you need to tell a story.
- Because you need to tell a story make the model as understandable as possible.

### Causal Loop Diagrams ###

- Specific Guidelines for how to depict the relationships between the elements.
- Color coding relations is an alternative to the + and - notation, though be consistent.
- Employing explicit stock representations often reduces misinterpretations.
- Hybrid Rich Pictures/Causal Loop Diagrams are often the very meaningful.

### Storytelling ###

- Makes it far easier for others to understand the insights you're trying to surface with your model.
