# Beyond Connecting the Dots - Content Thoughts v1.0 - 13.03.10 #

An interactive book on Systems Thinking and Modeling.
Mastering the hidden connections in everything that matters.
The following represents the current set of thoughts on the structure and content of the book.

## Cover ##

Simple and direct though it needs to depict connections or relationships. Some sort of network representation. I like the current cover though Scott said we probably can't get rights to use the image.

## Preface ##

* Why did we write this book
* Who is the target audience
* How is it arranged
* Specifically a solid introduction to an approach for improved understanding and decision making
* We will continually present examples from everyday life and then distill an understanding of those examples by building models
* This way we will repeatedly demonstrate how to improve our thinking to create understanding as a basis for better decision making.
* System One by Kauffman is a marvelous piece to keep in mind.

* A collection of relevant context examples will be employed from as broad a base as possible. This is expected to include models from, but not limited to, Biology, Business, Economics, Ecology, Environment, Governance, Health, Information Science, Math, Operations Management, Physics, Politics, Public Policy, Security, Sociology, Strategy, Zoology.

## Acknowledgment ##

* Listing all those who supported the effort through Kickstarter
* Other supporters via different avenues

## Table of Contents ##

At this point I would ask that you not get too hung up on the titles of the various sections and chapters. As the meaningfulness of the content develops I expect that the titles to be associated with the chapters should be relatively evident.

# Act I - The Foundation #

## Learning About the World Around Us ##

How we learn about ourselves and the world around us by building models. And we build lots of different kinds of models to help us understand. Provide examples of the models we build. Include thoughts on the way we reinforce our models, protect and evolve them. Explain the limitations of our models and how they are often flawed and the implications of operating with flawed models.

The chapter has to include lots of models to develop this understanding though at this point I expect the models are mostly picture images of various situations.

The Bertalanffy stuff goes in here somewhere - or maybe we shouldn't muck this part up and the Bertalanffy stuff should go in the preface

## Building Blocks of Better Thought ##

The world around us is dynamic and we function in that world dynamically though most of the models we build are static. The modes are just snapshots in time of the real dynamics of the world. We try to infer the implications of things in the future from snapshots of the past and present. And for reasons that will become evident this is a very inadequate basis for interacting in a meaningful way in the world.

From the examples previously presented and probably a few more here distill out an awareness of the concepts associated with a accumulator, flow, variable and connector. And use these elements to construct models of some of the example situations presented.

Then revisit the inadequate nature of these elements being used to build static pictures to understand a dynamic world.

Construct some simple dynamic models with no feedback just to begin to get a sense of the nature of doing a simulation.

## Basic Structures ##
 
Using examples from multiple disciplines synthesize the accumulator-flow structure, then the growth loop and balance loop. Use examples with the broadest possible connection.

After the two basic structures are developed talk about the valid ways the building blocks can be connected. What represents valid structure, what doesn't and why.

# Act II - Building on the Foundation #

## Implications of Reality ##

The following chapters actually represents the most common systems archetypes though we're not going to surface that fact until later. And we're definitely not going to use the term. The intent is to simply, via examples, and extend the two basic structures and then produce models for each of these extension. What we expect will happen is that the reader will develop an understanding of the value of critically thinking about the possible implications of the current structure and the various ways in which it may evolve into more complex structures.

For each chapter there are real world examples which are then developed into structure. The reader is asked to interact with the models provided and then asked to identify similar structures from their experience, clone the existing structure and update the model to reflect their example. And once the model is created it should be simulated.

I expect we will identify additional structures that should be included as chapters of this section.

The chapters below fix a problem and promote growth should be labeled as appropriately as possible so people connect with the nature of the interactions. As I've said previously, don't get hung up on the labels at this point. Once the content is elaborated I expect that the chapter titles will be self-evident.

## Trying to fix a problem ##

- Linear progress slows over time
- The fix overshoots the goal
- Things seem to oscillate endlessly
- The fix creates problems elsewhere
- In time the problem returns
- Underlying causes not being addressed
- Dependence on the fix develops
- Over time there is a tendency to settle for less
- Tendency to let the standard slip

## Trying to promote growth ##

- Growth slows over time
- Growth leads to decline elsewhere
- Partners for growth become adversaries
- Limited resources are shared by others
- More than one limit to be addressed
- The limit is insufficient capacity

## Structural Relationships ##

The final chapter should depict the relationships between the structures presented in the previous sections and explain the natural evolution paths for the structures.

# Act III - Applying the Learning #

## Applied Understanding ##

Now that we've worked though a large number of cross discipline models providing examples of how to ferret out understanding though the development of models lets talk about applying this approach to some real life situations.

I expect this section will actually be several chapters, each one dedicated to elaborating a different model. I also expect the models to be from very different disciplines.

The idea is to share the thought process associated with developing an understanding for a new situation from scratch.

This will probably be in some evolved form of the **Enabling a Better Tomorrow** or **Systemic Perspective** learning threads at [SystemsWiki.org](http://www.systemswiki.org/). There are YouTube play lists for [Network Magic](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?feature=edit_ok&list=PL6_vtryFPrNUS_gy59LhIncDYbBXmkdS9) and [AR Period Reduction](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6_vtryFPrNViDGlFlMlV5rMC390icYvB), two examples developed based on the learning threads.

How many chapters will this be? That sort of depends on how long it takes the group to identify them and develop a new meaningful surfacing approach.
